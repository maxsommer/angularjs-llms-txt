## error/index.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name Error Reference
@description

# Error Reference

Use the Error Reference manual to find information about error conditions in
your AngularJS app. Errors thrown in production builds of AngularJS will log
links to this site on the console.

Other useful references for debugging your app include:

- {@link api/ API Reference} for detailed information about specific features
- {@link guide/ Developer Guide} for AngularJS concepts
- {@link tutorial/ Tutorial} for getting started

## error/ng/aobj.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:aobj
@fullName Invalid Argument
@description

The argument passed should be an object. Check the value that was passed to the function where
this error was thrown.


---

## error/ng/areq.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:areq
@fullName Bad Argument
@description

AngularJS often asserts that certain values will be present and truthy using a helper function. If
the assertion fails, this error is thrown. To fix this problem, make sure that the value the
assertion expects is defined and matches the type mentioned in the error.

If the type is `undefined`, make sure any newly added controllers/directives/services are properly
defined and included in the script(s) loaded by your page.


---

## error/ng/badname.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:badname
@fullName Bad `hasOwnProperty` Name
@description

Occurs when you try to use the name `hasOwnProperty` in a context where it is not allowed.
Generally, a name cannot be `hasOwnProperty` because it is used, internally, on a object
and allowing such a name would break lookups on this object.


---

## error/ng/btstrpd.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:btstrpd
@fullName App Already Bootstrapped with this Element
@description

Occurs when calling {@link angular.bootstrap} on an element that has already been bootstrapped.

This usually happens when you accidentally use both `ng-app` and `angular.bootstrap` to bootstrap an
application.


```
<html>
...
  <body ng-app="myApp">
    <script>
      angular.bootstrap(document.body, ['myApp']);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that for bootstrapping purposes, the `<html>` element is the same as `document`, so the following
will also throw an error.

```
<html>
...
<script>
  angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']);
</script>
</html>
```

You can also get this error if you accidentally load AngularJS itself more than once.

```
<html ng-app>
  <head>
    <script src="angular.js"></script>

    ...

  </head>
  <body>

    ...

    <script src="angular.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```


---

## error/ng/cpi.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:cpi
@fullName Bad Copy
@description

This error occurs when attempting to copy an object to itself. Calling {@link
angular.copy angular.copy} with a `destination` object deletes
all of the elements or properties on `destination` before copying to it. Copying
an object to itself is not supported. Make sure to check your calls to
`angular.copy` and avoid copying objects or arrays to themselves.


---

## error/ng/cpta.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:cpta
@fullName Copying TypedArray
@description

Copying TypedArray's with a destination is not supported because TypedArray
objects can not be mutated, they are fixed length.


---

## error/ng/cpws.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:cpws
@fullName Copying Window or Scope
@description

Copying Window or Scope instances is not supported because of cyclical and self
references. Avoid copying windows and scopes, as well as any other cyclical or
self-referential structures. Note that trying to deep copy an object containing
cyclical references that is neither a window nor a scope will cause infinite
recursion and a stack overflow.


---

## error/ng/test.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ng:test
@fullName Testability Not Found
@description

AngularJS's testability helper, getTestability, requires a root element to be
passed in. This helps differentiate between different AngularJS apps on the same
page. This error is thrown when no injector is found for root element. It is
often because the root element is outside of the ng-app.


---

## error/$resource/badargs.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badargs
@fullName Too Many Arguments
@description

This error occurs when specifying too many arguments to a {@link ngResource.$resource `$resource`} action, such as `get`, `query` or any user-defined custom action.
These actions may take up to 4 arguments.

For more information, refer to the {@link ngResource.$resource `$resource`} API reference documentation.


---

## error/$resource/badcfg.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badcfg
@fullName Response does not match configured parameter
@description

This error occurs when the {@link ngResource.$resource `$resource`} service expects a response that can be deserialized as an array but receives an object, or vice versa.
By default, all resource actions expect objects, except `query` which expects arrays.

To resolve this error, make sure your `$resource` configuration matches the actual format of the data returned from the server.

For more information, see the {@link ngResource.$resource `$resource`} API reference documentation.


---

## error/$resource/badmember.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badmember
@fullName Syntax error in param value using @member lookup
@description

Occurs when there is a syntax error when attempting to extract a param
value from the data object.

Here's an example of valid syntax for `params` or `paramsDefault`:

````javascript
{
  bar: '@foo.bar'
}
````

The part following the `@`, `foo.bar` in this case, should be a simple
dotted member lookup using only ASCII identifiers.  This error occurs
when there is an error in that expression.  The following are all syntax
errors

 | Value   | Error          |
 |---------|----------------|
 | `@`     | Empty expression following `@`. |
 | `@1.a`  | `1` is an invalid javascript identifier. |
 | `@.a`   | Leading `.` is invalid. |
 | `@a[1]` | Only dotted lookups are supported (no index operator) |


---

## error/$resource/badname.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badname
@fullName Cannot use hasOwnProperty as a parameter name
@description

Occurs when you try to use the name `hasOwnProperty` as a name of a parameter.
Generally, a name cannot be `hasOwnProperty` because it is used, internally, on a object
and allowing such a name would break lookups on this object.


---

## error/ngModel/constexpr.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngModel:constexpr
@fullName Non-Constant Expression
@description

Some attributes used in conjunction with ngModel (such as ngTrueValue or ngFalseValue) will only
accept constant expressions.

Examples using constant expressions include:

```
<input type="checkbox" ng-model="..." ng-true-value="'truthyValue'">
<input type="checkbox" ng-model="..." ng-false-value="0">
```

Examples of non-constant expressions include:

```
<input type="checkbox" ng-model="..." ng-true-value="someValue">
<input type="checkbox" ng-model="..." ng-false-value="{foo: someScopeValue}">
```


---

## error/ngModel/datefmt.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngModel:datefmt
@fullName Model is not a date object
@description

All date-related inputs like `<input type="date">` require the model to be a `Date` object.
If the model is something else, this error will be thrown.
AngularJS does not set validation errors on the `<input>` in this case
as those errors are shown to the user, but the erroneous state was
caused by incorrect application logic and not by the user.



---

## error/ngModel/nonassign.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngModel:nonassign
@fullName Non-Assignable Expression
@description

This error occurs when expression the {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel} directive is bound to is a non-assignable expression.

Examples using assignable expressions include:

```
<input ng-model="namedVariable">
<input ng-model="myObj.someProperty">
<input ng-model="indexedArray[0]">
```

Examples of non-assignable expressions include:

```
<input ng-model="foo + bar">
<input ng-model="42">
<input ng-model="'oops'">
<input ng-model="myFunc()">
```

Always make sure that the expression bound via `ngModel` directive can be assigned to.

For more information, see the {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel API doc}.


---

## error/ngModel/nopromise.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngModel:nopromise
@fullName No promise
@description

The return value of an async validator, must always be a promise. If you want to return a
non-promise value, you can convert it to a promise using {@link ng.$q#resolve `$q.resolve()`} or
{@link ng.$q#reject `$q.reject()`}.

Example:

```
.directive('asyncValidator', function($q) {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    link: function(scope, elem, attrs, ngModel) {
      ngModel.$asyncValidators.myAsyncValidation = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
        if (/* I don't need to hit the backend API */) {
          return $q.resolve();     // to mark as valid or
          // return $q.reject();   // to mark as invalid
        } else {
          // ...send a request to the backend and return a promise
        }
      };
    }
  };
})
```


---

## error/ngModel/numfmt.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngModel:numfmt
@fullName Model is not of type `number`
@description

The `input[number]` and `input[range]` directives require the model to be a `number`.

If the model is something else, this error will be thrown.

AngularJS does not set validation errors on the `<input>` in this case
as this error is caused by incorrect application logic and not by bad input from the user.

If your model does not contain actual numbers then it is up to the application developer
to use a directive that will do the conversion in the `ngModel` `$formatters` and `$parsers`
pipeline.

## Example

In this example, our model stores the number as a string, so we provide the `stringToNumber`
directive to convert it into the format the `input[number]` directive expects.


<example module="numfmt-error-module" name="number-format-error">
 <file name="index.html">
  <table>
    <tr ng-repeat="x in ['0', '1']">
      <td>
        <input type="number" string-to-number ng-model="x" /> {{ x }} : {{ typeOf(x) }}
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
 </file>
 <file name="app.js">
  angular.module('numfmt-error-module', [])

  .run(function($rootScope) {
    $rootScope.typeOf = function(value) {
      return typeof value;
    };
  })

  .directive('stringToNumber', function() {
    return {
      require: 'ngModel',
      link: function(scope, element, attrs, ngModel) {
        ngModel.$parsers.push(function(value) {
          return '' + value;
        });
        ngModel.$formatters.push(function(value) {
          return parseFloat(value);
        });
      }
    };
  });
 </file>
</example>


---

## error/$controller/ctrlfmt.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $controller:ctrlfmt
@fullName Badly formed controller string
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.$controller $controller} service is called
with a string that does not match the supported controller string formats.

Supported formats:

1. `__name__`
2. `__name__ as __identifier__`

Neither `__name__` or `__identifier__` may contain spaces.

Example of incorrect usage that leads to this error:
```html
<!-- unclosed ng-controller attribute messes up the format -->
<div ng-controller="myController>
```

or

```js
// does not match `__name__` or `__name__ as __identifier__`
var myCtrl = $controller("mY contRoller", { $scope: newScope });
```

or

```js
directive("myDirective", function() {
  return {
    // does not match `__name__` or `__name__ as __identifier__`
    controller: "mY contRoller",
    link: function() {}
  };
});
```

To fix the examples above, ensure that the controller string matches the supported
formats, and that any html attributes which are used as controller expressions are
closed.


Please consult the {@link ng.$controller $controller} service api docs to learn more.


---

## error/$controller/ctrlreg.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $controller:ctrlreg
@fullName A controller with this name is not registered.
@description

This error occurs when the {@link ng.$controller `$controller()`} service is called
with a string that does not match any of the registered controllers. The controller service may have
been invoked directly, or indirectly, for example through the {@link ng.ngController `ngController`} directive,
or inside a {@link angular.Module#component component} / {@link angular.Module#directive directive} /
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#when route} definition (when using a string for the controller property).
Third-party modules can also instantiate controllers with the {@link ng.$controller `$controller()`} service.

Causes for this error can be:

1. Your reference to the controller has a typo. For example, in
the {@link ng.ngController `ngController`} directive attribute, in a {@link angular.Module#component component}
definition's controller property, or in the call to {@link ng.$controller `$controller()`}.
2. You have not registered the controller (neither via {@link angular.Module#controller `Module.controller`}
nor {@link ng.$controllerProvider#register `$controllerProvider.register()`}.
3. You have a typo in the *registered* controller name.


Please consult the {@link ng.$controller $controller} service api docs to learn more.


---

## error/$controller/noscp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $controller:noscp
@fullName Missing $scope object
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.$controller $controller} service is called in order to instantiate a new controller but no scope is provided via `$scope` property of the locals map.

Example of incorrect usage that leads to this error:
```
$controller(MyController);
//or
$controller(MyController, {scope: newScope});
```

To fix the example above please provide a scope (using the `$scope` property in the locals object) to the $controller call:

```
$controller(MyController, {$scope: newScope});
```

Please consult the {@link ng.$controller $controller} service api docs to learn more.


---

## error/ngRef/noctrl.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRef:noctrl
@fullName A controller for the value of `ngRefRead` could not be found on the element.
@description

This error occurs when the {@link ng.ngRef ngRef directive} specifies
a value in `ngRefRead` that cannot be resolved to a directive / component controller.

Causes for this error can be:

1. Your `ngRefRead` value has a typo.
2. You have a typo in the *registered* directive / component name.
3. The directive / component does not have a controller.

Note that `ngRefRead` takes the name of the component / directive, not the name of controller, and
also not the combination of directive and 'Controller'. For example, for a directive called 'myDirective',
the correct declaration is `<div ng-ref="$ctrl.ref" ng-ref-read="myDirective">`.


---

## error/ngRef/nonassign.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRef:nonassign
@fullName Non-Assignable Expression
@description

This error occurs when ngRef defines an expression that is not-assignable.

In order for ngRef to work, it must be possible to write the reference into the path defined with the expression.

For example, the following expressions are non-assignable:

```
<my-directive ng-ref="{}"></my-directive>

<my-directive ng-ref="myFn()"></my-directive>

<!-- missing attribute value is also invalid -->
<my-directive ng-ref></my-directive>

```

To resolve this error, use a path expression that is assignable:

```
<my-directive ng-ref="$ctrl.reference"></my-directive>

```


---

## error/$q/norslvr.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $q:norslvr
@fullName No resolver function passed to $Q
@description

Occurs when calling creating a promise using {@link $q} as a constructor, without providing the
required `resolver` function.

```
//bad
var promise = $q().then(doSomething);

//good
var promise = $q(function(resolve, reject) {
  waitForSomethingAsync.then(resolve);
}).then(doSomething);
```


---

## error/$q/qcycle.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $q:qcycle
@fullName Cannot resolve a promise with itself
@description

Occurs when resolving a promise with itself as the value, including returning the promise in a
function passed to `then`. The A+ 1.1 spec mandates that this behavior throw a TypeError.
https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec#the-promise-resolution-procedure

```
var promise = $q.defer().promise;

//bad
promise.then(function (val) {
  //Cannot return self
  return promise;
});

//good
promise.then(function (val) {
  return 'some other value';
});
```


---

## error/$animate/nongcls.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $animate:nongcls
@fullName `ng-animate` class not allowed
@description

This error occurs, when trying to set `$animateProvider.classNameFilter()` to a RegExp containing
the reserved `ng-animate` class. Since `.ng-animate` will be added/removed by `$animate` itself,
using it as part of the `classNameFilter` RegExp is not allowed.


---

## error/$animate/notcsel.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $animate:notcsel
@fullName Not class CSS selector
@description

Expecting a CSS selector for class. Class selectors must start with `.`, for example: `.my-class-name`.


---

## error/ngTransclude/orphan.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngTransclude:orphan
@fullName Orphan ngTransclude Directive
@description

Occurs when an `ngTransclude` occurs without a transcluded ancestor element.

This error often occurs when you have forgotten to set `transclude: true` in some directive definition, and then used `ngTransclude` in the directive's template.

To resolve, either remove the offending `ngTransclude` or check that `transclude: true` is included in the intended directive definition.

Consult the API documentation for {@link guide/directive writing directives} to learn more.


---

## error/$route/norout.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $route:norout
@fullName Tried updating route with no current route
@description

Occurs when an attempt is made to update the parameters on the current route when
there is no current route. This can happen if you try to call `$route.updateParams();`
before the first route transition has completed.

---

## error/$http/baddata.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $http:baddata
@fullName Bad JSON Data
@description

The default {@link ng.$http#default-transformations `transformResponse`} will try to parse the
response as JSON if the `Content-Type` header is `application/json`, or the response looks like a
valid JSON-stringified object or array.
This error occurs when that data is not a valid JSON object.

To resolve this error, make sure you pass valid JSON data to `transformResponse`. If the response
data looks like JSON, but has a different `Content-Type` header, you must
{@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request implement your own response
transformer on a per request basis}, or {@link ng.$http#default-transformations modify the default `$http` responseTransform}.


---

## error/$http/badjsonp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $http:badjsonp
@fullName Bad JSONP Request Configuration
@description

This error occurs when the URL generated from the configuration object contains a parameter with the
same name as the configured `jsonpCallbackParam` property; or when it contains a parameter whose
value is `JSON_CALLBACK`.

`$http` JSONP requests need to attach a callback query parameter to the URL. The name of this
parameter is specified in the configuration object (or in the defaults) via the `jsonpCallbackParam`
property. You must not provide your own parameter with this name in the configuration of the request.

In previous versions of AngularJS, you specified where to add the callback parameter value via the
`JSON_CALLBACK` placeholder. This is no longer allowed.

To resolve this error, remove any parameters that have the same name as the `jsonpCallbackParam`;
and/or remove any parameters that have a value of `JSON_CALLBACK`.

For more information, see the {@link ng.$http#jsonp `$http.jsonp()`} method API documentation.


---

## error/$http/badreq.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $http:badreq
@fullName Bad Request Configuration
@description

This error occurs when the request configuration parameter passed to the {@link ng.$http `$http`} service is not a valid object.
`$http` expects a single parameter, the request configuration object, but received a parameter that was not an object or did not contain valid properties.

The error message should provide additional context such as the actual value of the parameter that was received.
If you passed a string parameter, perhaps you meant to call one of the shorthand methods on `$http` such as `$http.get(…)`, etc.

To resolve this error, make sure you pass a valid request configuration object to `$http`.

For more information, see the {@link ng.$http `$http`} service API documentation.


---

## error/$sanitize/elclob.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $sanitize:elclob
@fullName Failed to sanitize html because the element is clobbered
@description

This error occurs when `$sanitize` sanitizer is unable to traverse the HTML because one or more of the elements in the
HTML have been "clobbered". This could be a sign that the payload contains code attempting to cause a DoS attack on the
browser.

Typically clobbering breaks the `nextSibling` property on an element so that it points to one of its child nodes. This
makes it impossible to walk the HTML tree without getting stuck in an infinite loop, which causes the browser to freeze.

---

## error/$sanitize/noinert.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $sanitize:noinert
@fullName Can't create an inert html document
@description

This error occurs when `$sanitize` sanitizer determines that `document.implementation.createHTMLDocument ` api is not supported by the current browser.

This api is necessary for safe parsing of HTML strings into DOM trees and without it the sanitizer can't sanitize the input.

The api is present in all supported browsers including IE 9.0, so the presence of this error usually indicates that AngularJS's `$sanitize` is being used on an unsupported platform.


---

## error/$sanitize/uinput.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $sanitize:uinput
@fullName Failed to sanitize html because the input is unstable
@description

This error occurs when `$sanitize` sanitizer tries to check the input for possible mXSS payload and the verification
errors due to the input mutating indefinitely. This could be a sign that the payload contains code exploiting an mXSS
vulnerability in the browser.

mXSS attack exploit browser bugs that cause some browsers parse a certain html strings into DOM, which once serialized
doesn't match the original input. These browser bugs can be exploited by attackers to create payload which looks
harmless to sanitizers, but due to mutations caused by the browser are turned into dangerous code once processed after
sanitization.


---

## error/ngOptions/iexp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngOptions:iexp
@fullName Invalid Expression
@description
This error occurs when 'ngOptions' is passed an expression that isn't in an expected form.

Here's an example of correct syntax:

```
<select ng-model="color" ng-options="c.name for c in colors">
```

For more information on valid expression syntax, see 'ngOptions' in {@link ng.directive:select select} directive docs.


---

## error/$injector/cdep.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:cdep
@fullName Circular Dependency
@description

This error occurs when the {@link angular.injector $injector} tries to get
a service that depends on itself, either directly or indirectly. To fix this,
construct your dependency chain such that there are no circular dependencies.

For example:

```
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .factory('myService', function (myService) {
    // ...
  })
  .controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, myService) {
    // ...
  });
```

When an instance of `MyCtrl` is created, the service `myService` will be created
by the `$injector`. `myService` depends on itself, which causes the `$injector`
to detect a circular dependency and throw the error.

For more information, see the {@link guide/di Dependency Injection Guide}.


---

## error/$injector/itkn.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:itkn
@fullName Bad Injection Token
@description

This error occurs when using a bad token as a dependency injection annotation.
Dependency injection annotation tokens should always be strings. Using any other
type will cause this error to be thrown.

Examples of code with bad injection tokens include:

```
var myCtrl = function ($scope, $http) { /* ... */ };
myCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', 42];

myAppModule.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', {}, function ($scope, $timeout) {
  // ...
}]);
```

The bad injection tokens are `42` in the first example and `{}` in the second.
To avoid the error, always use string literals for dependency injection annotation
tokens.

For an explanation of what injection annotations are and how to use them, refer
to the {@link guide/di Dependency Injection Guide}.


---

## error/$injector/modulerr.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:modulerr
@fullName Module Error
@description

This error occurs when a module fails to load due to some exception. The error
message above should provide additional context.

A common reason why the module fails to load is that you've forgotten to
include the file with the defined module or that the file couldn't be loaded.

### Using `ngRoute`

In AngularJS `1.2.0` and later, `ngRoute` has been moved to its own module.
If you are getting this error after upgrading to `1.2.x` or later, be sure that you've
installed {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`}.

### Monkey-patching AngularJS's `ng` module

This error can also occur if you have tried to add your own components to the `ng` module.
This has never been supported and from `1.3.0` it will actually trigger this error.
For instance the following code could trigger this error.

```js
angular.module('ng').filter('tel', function (){});
```

Instead create your own module and add it as a dependency to your application's top-level module.
See [#9692](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9692) and
[#7709](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7709) for more information


---

## error/$injector/nomod.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:nomod
@fullName Module Unavailable
@description

This error occurs when you declare a dependency on a module that isn't defined anywhere or hasn't
been loaded in the current browser context.

When you receive this error, check that the name of the module in question is correct and that the
file in which this module is defined has been loaded (either via `<script>` tag, loader like
require.js, or testing harness like karma).

A less common reason for this error is trying to "re-open" a module that has not yet been defined.

To define a new module, call {@link angular.module angular.module} with a name
and an array of dependent modules, like so:

```js
// When defining a module with no module dependencies,
// the array of dependencies should be defined and empty.
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
```

To retrieve a reference to the same module for further configuration, call
`angular.module` without the array argument.

```js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp');
```

Calling `angular.module` without the array of dependencies when the module has not yet been defined
causes this error to be thrown. To fix it, define your module with a name and an empty array, as in
the first example above.


---

## error/$injector/pget.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:pget
@fullName Provider Missing $get
@description

This error occurs when attempting to register a provider that does not have a
`$get` method. For example:

```
function BadProvider() {} // No $get method!
angular.module("myApp", [])
  .provider('bad', BadProvider);  // this throws the error
```

To fix the error, fill in the `$get` method on the provider like so:

```
function GoodProvider() {
  this.$get = angular.noop;
}
angular.module("myApp", [])
  .provider('good', GoodProvider);
```

For more information, refer to the {@link auto.$provide#provider
$provide.provider} api doc.


---

## error/$injector/strictdi.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:strictdi
@fullName Explicit annotation required
@description

This error occurs when attempting to invoke a function or provider which
has not been explicitly annotated, while the application is running with
strict-di mode enabled.

For example:

```
angular.module("myApp", [])
  // BadController cannot be invoked, because
  // the dependencies to be injected are not
  // explicitly listed.
  .controller("BadController", function($scope, $http, $filter) {
    // ...
  });
```

To fix the error, explicitly annotate the function using either the inline
bracket notation, or with the $inject property:

```
function GoodController1($scope, $http, $filter) {
  // ...
}
GoodController1.$inject = ["$scope", "$http", "$filter"];

angular.module("myApp", [])
  // GoodController1 can be invoked because it
  // had an $inject property, which is an array
  // containing the dependency names to be
  // injected.
  .controller("GoodController1", GoodController1)

  // GoodController2 can also be invoked, because
  // the dependencies to inject are listed, in
  // order, in the array, with the function to be
  // invoked trailing on the end.
  .controller("GoodController2", [
    "$scope",
    "$http",
    "$filter",
    function($scope, $http, $filter) {
      // ...
    }
  ]);

```

## error/$injector/undef.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:undef
@fullName Undefined Value
@description

This error results from registering a factory which does not return a value (or whose return value is undefined).

The following is an example of a factory which will throw this error upon injection:

```js
angular.module("badModule", []).
  factory("badFactory", function() {
    doLotsOfThings();
    butDontReturnAValue();
  });
```

In order to prevent the error, return a value of some sort, such as an object which exposes an API for working
with the injected object.

```js
angular.module("goodModule", []).
  factory("goodFactory", function() {
    doLotsOfThings();
    butDontReturnAValue();

    return {
        doTheThing: function methodThatDoesAThing() {
        }
    };
  });
```

## error/$injector/unpr.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $injector:unpr
@fullName Unknown Provider
@description

This error results from the `$injector` being unable to resolve a required
dependency. To fix this, make sure the dependency is defined and spelled
correctly. For example:

```
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('MyController', ['myService', function (myService) {
    // Do something with myService
  }]);
```

The above code will fail with `$injector:unpr` if `myService` is not defined.

Making sure each dependency is defined will fix the problem, as noted below.

```
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .service('myService', function () { /* ... */ })
  .controller('MyController', ['myService', function (myService) {
    // Do something with myService
  }]);
```

An unknown provider error can also be caused by accidentally redefining a
module using the `angular.module` API, as shown in the following example.

```
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .service('myCoolService', function () { /* ... */ });

angular.module('myModule', [])
  // myModule has already been created! This is not what you want!
  .directive('myDirective', ['myCoolService', function (myCoolService) {
    // This directive definition throws unknown provider, because myCoolService
    // has been destroyed.
  }]);
```

To fix this problem, make sure you only define each module with the
`angular.module(name, [requires])` syntax once across your entire project.
Retrieve it for subsequent use with `angular.module(name)`. The fixed example
is shown below.

```
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .service('myCoolService', function () { /* ... */ });

angular.module('myModule')
  .directive('myDirective', ['myCoolService', function (myCoolService) {
    // This directive definition does not throw unknown provider.
  }]);
```


Attempting to inject one controller into another will also throw an `Unknown provider` error:

```
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .controller('MyFirstController', function() { /* ... */ })
  .controller('MySecondController', ['MyFirstController', function(MyFirstController) {
    // This controller throws an unknown provider error because
    // MyFirstController cannot be injected.
  }]);
```

Use the `$controller` service if you want to instantiate controllers yourself.

Attempting to inject a scope object into anything that's not a controller or a directive,
for example a service, will also throw an `Unknown provider: $scopeProvider <- $scope` error.
This might happen if one mistakenly registers a controller as a service, ex.:

```
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .service('MyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    // This controller throws an unknown provider error because
    // a scope object cannot be injected into a service.
  }]);
```

If you encounter this error only with minified code, consider using `ngStrictDi` (see
{@link ng.directive:ngApp ngApp}) to provoke the error with the non-minified source.

## error/orderBy/notarray.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name orderBy:notarray
@fullName Value is not array-like
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.orderBy orderBy} is not passed an array-like value:
```html
<div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj | orderBy:someProp">
  {{ key }} : {{ value }}
</div>
```

`orderBy` must be used with an array-like value so a subset of items can be returned.
The array can be initialized asynchronously and therefore `null` or `undefined` won't throw this error.

To use `orderBy` to order the properties of an object, you can create your own array based on that object:
```js
angular.module('aModule', [])
  .controller('aController', function($scope) {
    var myObj = {
      one: {id: 1, name: 'Some thing'},
      two: {id: 2, name: 'Another thing'},
      three: {id: 3, name: 'A third thing'}
    };

    $scope.arrFromMyObj = Object.keys(myObj).map(function(key) {
      return myObj[key];
    });
  });
```
That can be used as:
```html
<label>
  Order by:
  <select ng-model="orderProp" ng-options="prop for prop in ['id', 'name']"></select>
</label>
<div ng-repeat="item in arrFromMyObj | orderBy:orderProp">
  [{{ item.id }}] {{ item.name }}
</div>
```

You could as well convert the object to an array using a filter such as
[toArrayFilter](https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter):
```html
<label>
  Order by:
  <select ng-model="orderProp" ng-options="prop for prop in ['id', 'name']"></select>
</label>
<div ng-repeat="item in myObj | toArray:false | orderBy:orderProp">
  [{{ item.id }}] {{ item.name }}
</div>
```

## error/linky/notstring.ngdoc

@description

This error occurs when {@link ngSanitize.linky linky} is used with a non-empty, non-string value:
```html
<div ng-bind-html="42 | linky"></div>
```

`linky` is supposed to be used with string values only, and therefore assumes that several methods
(such as `.match()`) are available on the passed in value.
The value can be initialized asynchronously and therefore null or undefined won't throw this error.

If you want to pass non-string values to `linky` (e.g. Objects whose `.toString()` should be
utilized), you need to manually convert them to strings.

## error/$location/badpath.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $location:badpath
@fullName Invalid Path
@description

This error occurs when the path of a location contains invalid characters.
The most common fault is when the path starts with double slashes (`//`) or backslashes ('\\').

To resolve this issue, please check the base url specified via the `<base>` tag in the head of your main html document, as well as the url that you tried to set the location to.


---

## error/$location/isrcharg.ngdoc

@ngdoc error

You can use the stack trace associated with this error to identify the call site that caused this issue.

To learn more, please consult the {@link ng.$location `$location`} api docs.


---

## error/$location/nobase.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $location:nobase
@fullName $location in HTML5 mode requires a &lt;base&gt; tag to be present!
@description

If you configure {@link ng.$location `$location`} to use
{@link $locationProvider `html5Mode`} (`history.pushState`), you need to specify the base URL for the application with a [`<base href="">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag or configure
`$locationProvider` to not require a base tag by passing a definition object with
`requireBase:false` to `$locationProvider.html5Mode()`:

```javascript
$locationProvider.html5Mode({
  enabled: true,
  requireBase: false
});
```

Note that removing the requirement for a `<base>` tag will have adverse side effects when resolving
relative paths with `$location` in IE9.

The base URL is then used to resolve all relative URLs throughout the application regardless of the
entry point into the app.

If you are deploying your app into the root context (e.g. `https://myapp.com/`), set the base URL to `/`:

```html
<head>
  <base href="/">
  ...
</head>
```

If you are deploying your app into a sub-context (e.g. `https://myapp.com/subapp/`), set the base URL to the
URL of the subcontext:

```html
<head>
  <base href="/subapp/">
  ...
</head>
```

Before AngularJS 1.3 we didn't have this hard requirement and it was easy to write apps that worked
when deployed in the root context but were broken when moved to a sub-context because in the
sub-context all absolute urls would resolve to the root context of the app. To prevent this,
use relative URLs throughout your app:

```html
<!-- wrong: -->
<a href="/userProfile">User Profile</a>


<!-- correct: -->
<a href="userProfile">User Profile</a>

```

Additionally, if you want to support [browsers that don't have the `history.pushState`
API](http://caniuse.com/#feat=history), the fallback mechanism provided by `$location`
won't work well without specifying the base url of the application.

In order to make it easier to migrate from hashbang mode to html5 mode, we require that the base
URL is always specified when `$location`'s `html5mode` is enabled.


---

## error/$location/nostate.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $location:nostate

@description

This error occurs when the {@link ng.$location#state $location.state} method is used when {@link ng.$locationProvider#html5Mode $locationProvider.html5Mode} is not turned on or the browser used doesn't support the HTML5 History API (for example, IE9 or Android 2.3).

## error/jqLite/nosel.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name jqLite:nosel
@fullName Unsupported Selector Lookup
@description

In order to keep AngularJS small, AngularJS implements only a subset of the selectors in {@link angular.element#angularjs-s-jqlite jqLite}.
This error occurs when a jqLite instance is invoked with a selector other than this subset.

In order to resolve this error, rewrite your code to only use tag name selectors and manually traverse the DOM using the APIs provided by jqLite.

Alternatively, you can include a full version of jQuery, which AngularJS will automatically use and that will make all selectors available.

## error/ngRepeat/badident.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRepeat:badident
@fullName Invalid identifier expression
@description

Occurs when an invalid identifier is specified in an {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} expression.

The {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} directive's `alias as` syntax is used to assign an alias for the processed collection in scope.

If the expression is not a simple identifier (such that you could declare it with `var {name}`, or if the expression is a reserved name,
this error is thrown.

Reserved names include:

  - `null`
  - `this`
  - `undefined`
  - `$parent`
  - `$id`
  - `$root`
  - `$even`
  - `$odd`
  - `$first`
  - `$last`
  - `$middle`

Invalid expressions might look like this:

```html
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as this">{{item}}</li>
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as some.objects["property"]">{{item}}</li>
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as resultOfSomeMethod()">{{item}}</li>
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as foo=6">{{item}}</li>
```

Valid expressions might look like this:

```html
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as collections">{{item}}</li>
<li ng-repeat="item in items | filter:searchString as filteredCollection">{{item}}</li>
```


---

## error/ngRepeat/dupes.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRepeat:dupes
@fullName Duplicate Key in Repeater
@description

Occurs if there are duplicate keys in an {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} expression.  Duplicate keys are banned because AngularJS uses keys to associate DOM nodes with items.

By default, collections are keyed by reference which is desirable for most common models but can be problematic for primitive types that are interned (share references).

For example the issue can be triggered by this *invalid* code:

```
<div ng-repeat="value in [4, 4]"></div>
```

To resolve this error either ensure that the items in the collection have unique identity or use the `track by` syntax to specify how to track the association between models and DOM.

The example above can be resolved by using `track by $index`, which will cause the items to be keyed by their position in the array instead of their value:

```
<div ng-repeat="value in [4, 4] track by $index"></div>
```


---

## error/ngRepeat/iexp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRepeat:iexp
@fullName Invalid Expression
@description

Occurs when there is a syntax error in an {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat}'s expression. The expression should be in the form '_item_ in _collection_[ track by _id_]'.

Be aware, the ngRepeat directive parses the expression using a regex before sending _collection_ and optionally _id_ to the AngularJS parser.  This error comes from the regex parsing.

To resolve, identify and fix errors in the expression, paying special attention to the 'in' and 'track by' keywords in the expression.

Please consult the api documentation of {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} to learn more about valid syntax.


---

## error/ngRepeat/iidexp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngRepeat:iidexp

@description

Occurs when there is an error in the identifier part of {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat}'s expression.

To resolve, use either a valid identifier or a tuple (_key_, _value_) where both _key_ and _value_ are valid identifiers.

Examples of *invalid* syntax:

```
<div ng-repeat="33 in users"></div>
<div ng-repeat="someFn() in users"></div>
<div ng-repeat="some user in users"></div>
```

Examples of *valid* syntax:

```

## error/$sce/insecurl.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $sce:insecurl
@fullName Processing of a Resource from Untrusted Source Blocked
@description

AngularJS' {@link ng.$sce Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)} mode (enabled by default) has blocked loading a resource from an insecure URL.

Typically, this would occur if you're attempting to load an AngularJS template from an untrusted source.
It's also possible that a custom directive threw this error for a similar reason.

AngularJS only loads templates from trusted URLs (by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL).

By default, only URLs that belong to the same origin are trusted. These are urls with the same domain, protocol and port as the application document.

The {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directive and {@link guide/directive directives} that specify a `templateUrl` require a trusted resource URL.

To load templates from other domains and/or protocols, either adjust the {@link
ng.$sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList trusted resource URL list}/ {@link
ng.$sceDelegateProvider#bannedResourceUrlList banned resource URL list} or wrap the URL with a call to {@link
ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl $sce.trustAsResourceUrl}.

**Note**: The browser's [Same Origin
Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest) and
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) policy apply

@fullName Require a safe/trusted value
@description

The value provided for use in a specific context was not found to be safe/trusted for use.

AngularJS's {@link ng.$sce Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)} mode
(enabled by default), requires bindings in certain
contexts to result in a value that is trusted as safe for use in such a context.  (e.g. loading an
AngularJS template from a URL requires that the URL is one considered safe for loading resources.)

This helps prevent XSS and other security issues.  Read more at

## error/$interval/badprom.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $interval:badprom
@fullName Non-$interval promise
@description

This error occurs when calling {@link ng.$interval#cancel $interval.cancel()} with a promise that
was not generated by the {@link ng.$interval $interval} service. This can, for example, happen when
calling {@link ng.$q#the-promise-api then()/catch()} on the returned promise, which creates a new
promise, and pass that new promise to {@link ng.$interval#cancel $interval.cancel()}.

Example of incorrect usage that leads to this error:

```js
var promise = $interval(doSomething, 1000, 5).then(doSomethingElse);
$interval.cancel(promise);
```

To fix the example above, keep a reference to the promise returned by
{@link ng.$interval $interval()} and pass that to {@link ng.$interval#cancel $interval.cancel()}:

```js
var promise = $interval(doSomething, 1000, 5);
var newPromise = promise.then(doSomethingElse);
$interval.cancel(promise);
```

## error/filter/notarray.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name filter:notarray
@fullName Not an array
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.filter filter} is not used with an array:
```html
<input ng-model="search">
<div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj | filter:search">
  {{ key }} : {{ value }}
</div>
```

Filter must be used with an array so a subset of items can be returned.
The array can be initialized asynchronously and therefore null or undefined won't throw this error.

To filter an object by the value of its properties you can create your own custom filter:
```js
angular.module('customFilter',[])
  .filter('custom', function() {
    return function(input, search) {
      if (!input) return input;
      if (!search) return input;
      var expected = ('' + search).toLowerCase();
      var result = {};
      angular.forEach(input, function(value, key) {
        var actual = ('' + value).toLowerCase();
        if (actual.indexOf(expected) !== -1) {
          result[key] = value;
        }
      });
      return result;
    }
  });
```
That can be used as:
```html
<input ng-model="search">
<div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj | custom:search">
  {{ key }} : {{ value }}
</div>
```

You could as well convert the object to an array using a filter such as
[toArrayFilter](https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter):
```html
<input ng-model="search">
<div ng-repeat="item in myObj | toArray:false | filter:search">
  {{ item }}
</div>
```

## error/$rootScope/infdig.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $rootScope:infdig
@fullName Infinite $digest Loop
@description

This error occurs when the application's model becomes unstable and each `$digest` cycle triggers a state change and subsequent `$digest` cycle.
AngularJS detects this situation and prevents an infinite loop from causing the browser to become unresponsive.

For example, the situation can occur by setting up a watch on a path and subsequently updating the same path when the value changes.

```
$scope.$watch('foo', function() {
  $scope.foo = $scope.foo + 1;
});
```

One common mistake is binding to a function which generates a new array every time it is called.  For example:

```
<div ng-repeat="user in getUsers()">{{ user.name }}</div>

...

$scope.getUsers = function() {
  return [ { name: 'Hank' }, { name: 'Francisco' } ];
};
```

Since `getUsers()` returns a new array, AngularJS determines that the model is different on each `$digest`
cycle, resulting in the error.  The solution is to return the same array object if the elements have
not changed:

```
var users = [ { name: 'Hank' }, { name: 'Francisco' } ];

$scope.getUsers = function() {
  return users;
};
```

The maximum number of allowed iterations of the `$digest` cycle is controlled via TTL setting which can be configured via {@link ng.$rootScopeProvider $rootScopeProvider}.

## error/$rootScope/inprog.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $rootScope:inprog
@fullName Action Already In Progress
@description

At any point in time there can be only one `$digest` or `$apply` operation in progress. This is to
prevent very hard to detect bugs from entering your application. The stack trace of this error
allows you to trace the origin of the currently executing `$apply` or `$digest` call, which caused
the error.

## Background

AngularJS uses a dirty-checking digest mechanism to monitor and update values of the scope during
the processing of your application.  The digest works by checking all the values that are being
watched against their previous value and running any watch handlers that have been defined for those
values that have changed.

This digest mechanism is triggered by calling `$digest` on a scope object.  Normally you do not need
to trigger a digest manually, because every external action that can trigger changes in your
application, such as mouse events, timeouts or server responses, wrap the AngularJS application code
in a block of code that will run `$digest` when the code completes.

You wrap AngularJS code in a block that will be followed by a `$digest` by calling `$apply` on a scope
object.  So, in pseudo-code, the process looks like this:

```
element.on('mouseup', function() {
  scope.$apply(function() {
    $scope.doStuff();
  });
});
```

where `$apply()` looks something like:

```
$apply = function(fn) {
  try {
    fn();
  } finally() {
    $digest();
  }
}
```

## Digest Phases

AngularJS keeps track of what phase of processing we are in, the relevant ones being `$apply` and
`$digest`.  Trying to reenter a `$digest` or `$apply` while one of them is already in progress is
typically a sign of programming error that needs to be fixed. So AngularJS will throw this error when
that occurs.

In most situations it should be well defined whether a piece of code will be run inside an `$apply`,
in which case you should not be calling `$apply` or `$digest`, or it will be run outside, in which
case you should wrap any code that will be interacting with AngularJS scope or services, in a call to
`$apply`.

As an example, all Controller code should expect to be run within AngularJS, so it should have no need
to call `$apply` or `$digest`.  Conversely, code that is being trigger directly as a call back to
some external event, from the DOM or 3rd party library, should expect that it is never called from
within AngularJS, and so any AngularJS application code that it calls should first be wrapped in a call
to $apply.

## Common Causes

Apart from simply incorrect calls to `$apply` or `$digest` there are some cases when you may get
this error through no fault of your own.

### Inconsistent API (Sync/Async)

This error is often seen when interacting with an API that is sometimes sync and sometimes async.

For example, imagine a 3rd party library that has a method which will retrieve data for us. Since it
may be making an asynchronous call to a server, it accepts a callback function, which will be called
when the data arrives.

```
function MyController($scope, thirdPartyComponent) {
  thirdPartyComponent.getData(function(someData) {
    $scope.$apply(function() {
      $scope.someData = someData;
    });
  });
}
```

We expect that our callback will be called asynchronously, and so from outside AngularJS. Therefore, we
correctly wrap our application code that interacts with AngularJS in a call to `$apply`.

The problem comes if `getData()` decides to call the callback handler synchronously; perhaps it has
the data already cached in memory and so it immediately calls the callback to return the data,
synchronously.

Since, the `MyController` constructor is always instantiated from within an `$apply` call, our
handler is trying to enter a new `$apply` block from within one.

This is not an ideal design choice on the part of the 3rd party library.

To resolve this type of issue, either fix the api to be always synchronous or asynchronous or force
your callback handler to always run asynchronously by using the `$timeout` service.

```
function MyController($scope, $timeout, thirdPartyComponent) {
  thirdPartyComponent.getData(function(someData) {
    $timeout(function() {
      $scope.someData = someData;
    }, 0);
  });
}
```

Here we have used `$timeout` to schedule the changes to the scope in a future call stack.
By providing a timeout period of 0ms, this will occur as soon as possible and `$timeout` will ensure
that the code will be called in a single `$apply` block.

### Triggering Events Programmatically

The other situation that often leads to this error is when you trigger code (such as a DOM event)
programmatically (from within AngularJS), which is normally called by an external trigger.

For example, consider a directive that will set focus on an input control when a value in the scope
is true:

```
myApp.directive('setFocusIf', function() {
  return {
    link: function($scope, $element, $attr) {
      $scope.$watch($attr.setFocusIf, function(value) {
        if ( value ) { $element[0].focus(); }
      });
    }
  };
});
```

If we applied this directive to an input which also used the `ngFocus` directive to trigger some
work when the element receives focus we will have a problem:

```
<input set-focus-if="hasFocus" ng-focus="msg='has focus'">
<button ng-click="hasFocus = true">Focus</button>
```

In this setup, there are two ways to trigger ngFocus. First from a user interaction:

* Click on the input control
* The input control gets focus
* The `ngFocus` directive is triggered, setting `$scope.msg='has focus'` from within a new call to
`$apply()`

Second programmatically:

* Click the button
* The `ngClick` directive sets the value of `$scope.hasFocus` to true inside a call to `$apply`
* The `$digest` runs, which triggers the watch inside the `setFocusIf` directive
* The watch's handle runs, which gives the focus to the input
* The `ngFocus` directive is triggered, setting `$scope.msg='has focus'` from within a new call to
`$apply()`

In this second scenario, we are already inside a `$digest` when the ngFocus directive makes another
call to `$apply()`, causing this error to be thrown.

It is possible to workaround this problem by moving the call to set the focus outside of the digest,
by using `$timeout(fn, 0, false)`, where the `false` value tells AngularJS not to wrap this `fn` in an
`$apply` block:

```
myApp.directive('setFocusIf', function($timeout) {
  return {
    link: function($scope, $element, $attr) {
      $scope.$watch($attr.setFocusIf, function(value) {
        if ( value ) {
          $timeout(function() {
            // We must reevaluate the value in case it was changed by a subsequent
            // watch handler in the digest.
            if ( $scope.$eval($attr.setFocusIf) ) {
              $element[0].focus();
            }
          }, 0, false);
        }
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## Diagnosing This Error

When you get this error it can be rather daunting to diagnose the cause of the issue.  The best
course of action is to investigate the stack trace from the error.  You need to look for places
where `$apply` or `$digest` have been called and find the context in which this occurred.

There should be two calls:

* The first call is the good `$apply`/`$digest` and would normally be triggered by some event near
the top of the call stack.

* The second call is the bad `$apply`/`$digest` and this is the one to investigate.

Once you have identified this call you work your way up the stack to see what the problem is.

* If the second call was made in your application code then you should look at why this code has been
called from within an `$apply`/`$digest`.  It may be a simple oversight or maybe it fits with the
sync/async scenario described earlier.

* If the second call was made inside an AngularJS directive then it is likely that it matches the second
programmatic event trigger scenario described earlier.  In this case you may need to look further up
the tree to what triggered the event in the first place.

### Example Problem

Let's look at how to investigate this error using the `setFocusIf` example from above. This example
defines a new `setFocusIf` directive that sets the focus on the element where it is defined when the
value of its attribute becomes true.

<example name="error-$rootScope-inprog" module="app">
  <file name="index.html">
    <button ng-click="focusInput = true">Focus</button>
    <input ng-focus="count = count + 1" set-focus-if="focusInput" />
  </file>
  <file name="app.js">
    angular.module('app', []).directive('setFocusIf', function() {
      return function link($scope, $element, $attr) {
        $scope.$watch($attr.setFocusIf, function(value) {
          if (value) { $element[0].focus(); }
        });
      };
    });
  </file>
</example>

When you click on the button to cause the focus to occur we get our `$rootScope:inprog` error. The
stacktrace looks like this:

```
Error: [$rootScope:inprog]
    at Error (native)
    at angular.min.js:6:467
    at n (angular.min.js:105:60)

    at Array.forEach (native)

(anonymous function) angular.js:2890
q angular.js:320

$get.g.$digest angular.js:12469
$get.g.$apply angular.js:12742                   <--- $apply
(anonymous function) angular.js:19833            <--- called here
(anonymous function) angular.js:2890
q angular.js:320
```

We can see (even though the AngularJS code is minified) that there were two calls to `$apply`, first
on line `19833`, then on line `12738` of `angular.js`.

It is this second call that caused the error.  If we look at the angular.js code, we can see that
this call is made by an AngularJS directive.

```
var ngEventDirectives = {};
forEach(
  'click dblclick mousedown mouseup mouseover mouseout mousemove mouseenter mouseleave keydown keyup keypress submit focus blur copy cut paste'.split(' '),
  function(name) {
    var directiveName = directiveNormalize('ng-' + name);
    ngEventDirectives[directiveName] = ['$parse', function($parse) {
      return {
        compile: function($element, attr) {
          var fn = $parse(attr[directiveName]);
          return function(scope, element, attr) {
            element.on(lowercase(name), function(event) {
              scope.$apply(function() {
                fn(scope, {$event:event});
              });
            });
          };
        }
      };
    }];
  }
);
```

It is not possible to tell which from the stack trace, but we happen to know in this case that it is
the `ngFocus` directive.

Now look up the stack to see that our application code is only entered once in `app.js` at line `12`.
This is where our problem is:

```
10: link: function($scope, $element, $attr) {
11:   $scope.$watch($attr.setFocusIf, function(value) {
12:     if ( value ) { $element[0].focus(); }    <---- This is the source of the problem
13:   });
14: }
```

We can now see that the second `$apply` was caused by us programmatically triggering a DOM event
(i.e. focus) to occur. We must fix this by moving the code outside of the $apply block using
`$timeout` as described above.

@description

This error occurs when {@link $templateRequest} attempts to fetch a template from some URL, and
the request fails.

The template URL might be defined in a directive/component definition, an instance of `ngInclude`,
an instance of `ngMessagesInclude` or a templated route in a `$route` route definition.

To resolve this error, ensure that the URL of the template is spelled correctly and resolves to

## error/$compile/ctreq.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:ctreq
@fullName Missing Required Controller
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.$compile HTML compiler} tries to process a directive that specifies the {@link ng.$compile#directive-definition-object `require` option} in a {@link ng.$compile#comprehensive-directive-api directive definition},
but the required directive controller is not present on the current DOM element (or its ancestor element, if `^` was specified).

To resolve this error ensure that there is no typo in the required controller name and that the required directive controller is present on the current element.

If the required controller is expected to be on an ancestor element, make sure that you prefix the controller name in the `require` definition with `^`.

If the required controller is optionally requested, use `?` or `^?` to specify that.


Example of a directive that requires {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel} controller:
```
myApp.directive('myDirective', function() {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    ...
  }
}
```

This directive can then be used as:
```
<input ng-model="some.path" my-directive>
```


Example of a directive that optionally requires a {@link ng.directive:form form} controller from an ancestor:
```
myApp.directive('myDirective', function() {
  return {
    require: '^?form',
    ...
  }
}
```

This directive can then be used as:
```
<form name="myForm">

## error/$compile/infchng.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:infchng
@fullName Unstable `$onChanges` hooks
@description

This error occurs when the application's model becomes unstable because some `$onChanges` hooks are causing updates which then trigger
further calls to `$onChanges` that can never complete.
AngularJS detects this situation and prevents an infinite loop from causing the browser to become unresponsive.

For example, the situation can occur by setting up a `$onChanges()` hook which triggers an event on the component, which subsequently
triggers the component's bound inputs to be updated:

```html
<c1 prop="a" on-change="a = -a"></c1>
```

```js
function Controller1() {}
Controller1.$onChanges = function() {
  this.onChange();
};

mod.component('c1', {
  controller: Controller1,
  bindings: {'prop': '<', onChange: '&'}
}
```

The maximum number of allowed iterations of the `$onChanges` hooks is controlled via TTL setting which can be configured via
{@link ng.$compileProvider#onChangesTtl `$compileProvider.onChangesTtl`}.

## error/$compile/missingattr.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:missingattr
@fullName Missing required attribute
@description

This error may occur only when {@link $compileProvider#strictComponentBindingsEnabled `$compileProvider.strictComponentBindingsEnabled`} is set to `true`.

If that is the case, then all {@link $compileProvider#component component} controller bindings and
{@link $compileProvider#directive directive} scope / controller bindings that are non-optional,
must be provided when the directive is instantiated.

To make a binding optional, add '?' to the definition.

## Example:

```js

app.component('myTest', {
  bindings: {
    first: '=?', // optional
    second: '='
  },
  controller: function() {
    ...
  },
  template: '...'

To resolve this issue remove one of the directives which is causing the collision.

Example scenarios of multiple incompatible directives applied to the same element include:

* Multiple directives requesting `isolated scope`.
* Multiple directives publishing a controller under the same name.
* Multiple directives declared with the `transclusion` option.
* Multiple directives attempting to define a `template` or `templateURL`.

This error occurs when a single element is linked more then once.

For example, if an element is compiled and linked twice without cloning:
```
  var linker = $compile(template);

  linker($scope); //=> multilink error
```

Linking an element as a clone multiple times is ok:
```
  var linker = $compile(template);
  linker($scope, function() { ... });     //=> ok
  linker($scope, function() { ... });     //=> ok
```

However once an element has been linked it can not be re-linked as a clone:
```
  var linker = $compile(template);
  linker($scope);                       //=> ok

## error/$compile/nodomevents.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:nodomevents
@fullName Event Attribute/Property Binding
@description

This error occurs when one tries to create a binding for event handler attributes or properties like `onclick`, `onload`, `onsubmit`, etc.

There is no practical value in binding to these attributes/properties and doing so only exposes your application to security vulnerabilities like XSS.
For these reasons binding to event handler attributes and properties (`formaction` and all starting with `on`) is not supported.


An example code that would allow XSS vulnerability by evaluating user input in the window context could look like this:
```
<input ng-model="username">
<div onclick="{{username}}">click me</div>
```

Since the `onclick` evaluates the value as JavaScript code in the window context, setting the `username` model to a value like `javascript:alert('PWND')` would result in script injection when the `div` is clicked.

Please use the `ng-*` or `ng-on-*` versions instead (such as `ng-click` or `ng-on-click` rather than `onclick`).

(using the `=` mode in the {@link ng.$compile#directive-definition-object
`scope` option} of a directive definition) but the directive is used with an expression that is not-assignable.

In order for the two-way data-binding to work, it must be possible to write new values back into the path defined with the expression.

For example, given a directive:

```
myModule.directive('myDirective', function factory() {
  return {
    ...
    scope: {
      localValue: '=bind'
    }
    ...
  }
});
```

Following are invalid uses of this directive:
```
<!-- ERROR because `1+2=localValue` is an invalid statement -->
<my-directive bind="1+2">

<!-- ERROR because `myFn()=localValue` is an invalid statement -->
<my-directive bind="myFn()">

<!-- ERROR because attribute bind wasn't provided -->
<my-directive>
```


To resolve this error, do one of the following options:

- use path expressions with scope properties that are two-way data-bound like so:

```
<my-directive bind="some.property">
<my-directive bind="some[3]['property']">
```

- Make the binding optional

```
myModule.directive('myDirective', function factory() {
  return {
    ...
    scope: {
      localValue: '=?bind' // <-- the '?' makes it optional
    }
    ...
  }
});
```

## error/$compile/noslot.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:noslot
@fullName No matching slot in parent directive
@description

This error occurs when declaring a specific slot in a {@link ng.ngTransclude `ngTransclude`} 
which does not map to a specific slot defined in the transclude property of the directive.

In this example the template has declared a slot missing from the transclude definition.
This example will generate a noslot error.
```js
var componentConfig = {
  template: '<div>' +
                '<div ng-transclude="slotProvided"></div>' +
                '<div ng-transclude="noSlotProvided"></div>' +
            '</div>',
  transclude: {
  	// The key value pairs here are considered "slots" that are provided for components to slot into.
    slotProvided: 'slottedComponent', // mandatory transclusion
    // There is no slot provided here for the transclude 'noSlotProvided' declared in the above template.
  }
};
```

If we make the following change we will no longer get the noslot error.
```js
var componentConfig = {
  template: '<div>' +
                '<div ng-transclude="slotProvided"></div>' +
                '<div ng-transclude="noSlotProvided"></div>' +
            '</div>',
  transclude: {
    slotProvided: 'slottedComponent',
    noSlotProvided: 'otherComponent' // now it is declared and the error should cease
  }
};

```

## error/$compile/reqslot.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:reqslot
@fullName Required transclusion slot
@description

This error occurs when a directive or component try to transclude a slot that is not provided.

Transcluded elements must contain something. This error could happen when you try to transclude a self closing tag element.
Also you can make a transclusion slot optional with a `?` prefix.

```js
// In this example the <my-component> must have an <important-component> inside to transclude it.
// If not, a reqslot error will be generated.

var componentConfig = {
  template: 'path/to/template.html',
  transclude: {
    importantSlot: 'importantComponent', // mandatory transclusion
    optionalSlot: '?optionalComponent',  // optional transclusion
  }
};

angular
  .module('doc')
  .component('myComponent', componentConfig)

```

```html
<!-- Will not work because <important-component> is missing -->
<my-component>
</my-component>

<my-component>
  <optional-component></optional-component>
</my-component>

<!-- Will work -->
<my-component>
  <important-component></important-component>
</my-component>

<my-component>
  <optional-component></optional-component>
  <important-component></important-component>
</my-component>
```

## error/$compile/selmulti.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:selmulti
@fullName Binding to Multiple Attribute
@description

Binding to the `multiple` attribute of `select` element is not supported since switching between multiple and single mode changes the {@link ng.directive:ngModel `ngModel`} object type from instance to array of instances which breaks the model semantics.

If you need to use different types of `select` elements in your template based on some variable, please use {@link ng.directive:ngIf ngIf} or {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch ngSwitch} directives to select one of them to be used at runtime.


Example with invalid usage:
```
<select ng-model="some.model" multiple="{{mode}}"></select>
```

Example that uses ngIf to pick one of the `select` elements based on a variable:
```
<select ng-if="mode == 'multiple'" ng-model="some.model" multiple></select>
<select ng-if="mode != 'multiple'" ng-model="some.model"></select>
```


---

## error/$compile/srcset.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:srcset
@fullName Invalid value passed to `attr.$set('srcset', value)`
@description

This error occurs if you try to programmatically set the `srcset` attribute with a non-string value.

This can be the case if you tried to avoid the automatic sanitization of the `srcset` value by
passing a "trusted" value provided by calls to `$sce.trustAsMediaUrl(value)`.

If you want to programmatically set explicitly trusted unsafe URLs, you should use `$sce.trustAsHtml`
on the whole `img` tag and inject it into the DOM using the `ng-bind-html` directive.


---

## error/$compile/tplrt.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:tplrt
@fullName Invalid Template Root
@description

When a directive is declared with `template` (or `templateUrl`) and `replace` mode on, the template
must have exactly one root element. That is, the text of the template property or the content
referenced by the templateUrl must be contained within a single html element.
For example, `<p>blah <em>blah</em> blah</p>` instead of simply `blah <em>blah</em> blah`.
Otherwise, the replacement operation would result in a single element (the directive) being replaced
with multiple elements or nodes, which is unsupported and not commonly needed in practice.


For example a directive with definition:

```
myModule.directive('myDirective', function factory() {
  return {
    ...
    replace: true,
    templateUrl: 'someUrl'
    ...
  }
});
```

And a template provided at URL `someUrl`. The template must be an html fragment that has only a
single root element, like the `div` element in this template:

```
<div><b>Hello</b> World!</div>
```

An invalid template to be used with this directive is one that defines multiple root nodes or
elements. For example:

```
<b>Hello</b> World!
```

Watch out for html comments at the beginning or end of templates, as these can cause this error as
well.  Consider the following template:

```
<div class='container'>
  <div class='wrapper'>
     ...
  </div> <!-- wrapper -->
</div> <!-- container -->
```

The `<!-- container -->` comment is interpreted as a second root element and causes the template to
be invalid.

## error/$compile/uterdir.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $compile:uterdir
@fullName Unterminated Directive
@description

This error occurs when using multi-element directives and a `directive-start` attribute fails to form a matching pair with a corresponding `directive-end` attribute.
A `directive-start` should have a matching `directive-end` on a sibling node in the DOM. For instance,

```
<table>
  <tr ng-repeat-start="item in list">I get repeated</tr>
  <tr ng-repeat-end>I also get repeated</tr>
</table>
```

is a valid example.

This error can occur in several different ways. One is by leaving out the `directive-end` attribute, like so:

```
<div>
  <span foo-start></span>
</div>
```

Another is by nesting a `directive-end` inside of `directive-start`, or vice versa:

```
<div>
  <span foo-start><span foo-end></span></span>
</div>
```

To avoid this error, make sure each `directive-start` you use has a matching `directive-end` on a sibling node in the DOM.

## error/ngPattern/noregexp.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name ngPattern:noregexp
@fullName Expected Regular Expression
@description
This error occurs when 'ngPattern' is passed an expression that isn't a regular expression or doesn't have the expected format.

For more information on valid expression syntax, see 'ngPattern' in {@link ng.directive:input input} directive docs.


---

## error/$timeout/badprom.ngdoc

@ngdoc error
@name $timeout:badprom
@fullName Non-$timeout promise
@description

This error occurs when calling {@link ng.$timeout#cancel $timeout.cancel()} with a promise that
was not generated by the {@link ng.$timeout $timeout} service. This can, for example, happen when
calling {@link ng.$q#the-promise-api then()/catch()} on the returned promise, which creates a new
promise, and pass that new promise to {@link ng.$timeout#cancel $timeout.cancel()}.

Example of incorrect usage that leads to this error:

```js
var promise = $timeout(doSomething, 1000).then(doSomethingElse);
$timeout.cancel(promise);
```

To fix the example above, keep a reference to the promise returned by
{@link ng.$timeout $timeout()} and pass that to {@link ng.$timeout#cancel $timeout.cancel()}:

```js
var promise = $timeout(doSomething, 1000);
var newPromise = promise.then(doSomethingElse);
$timeout.cancel(promise);
```

## misc/downloading.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name Downloading
@description

# Including AngularJS scripts from the Google CDN
The quickest way to get started is to point your html `<script>` tag to a Google CDN URL.
This way, you don't have to download anything or maintain a local copy.

There are two types of AngularJS script URLs you can point to, one for development and one for
production:

* __angular.js__ — This is the human-readable, non-minified version, suitable for web development.
* __angular.min.js__ — This is the minified version, which we strongly suggest you use in
  production.

To point your code to an AngularJS script on the Google CDN server, use the following template. This
example points to the minified version 1.5.6:

```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html ng-app>
    <head>
      <title>My AngularJS App</title>
      <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
  </html>
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note that only versions 1.0.1 and above are available on the CDN. If you need an earlier version
  (which you shouldn't) you can use the https://code.angularjs.org/ URL, which was the previous
  recommended location for hosted code source. If you're still using the AngularJS server you should
  switch to the CDN version for even faster loading times.
</div>

<br />
# Downloading and hosting AngularJS files locally
This option is for those who want to work with AngularJS offline, or those who want to host the
AngularJS files on their own servers.

If you navigate to https://code.angularjs.org/, you'll see a directory listing with all of the
AngularJS versions since we started releasing versioned build artifacts. Each directory contains all
artifacts that we released for a particular version. Download the version you want and have fun.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  You can ignore directories starting with `2.` (e.g. `2.0.0-beta.17`) — they are not related to
  AngularJS. They contain build artifacts from [Angular](https://angular.io) versions.
</div>

<br />
Each directory under https://code.angularjs.org/ includes a set of files that comprise the
corresponding version. All JavaScript files (except for `angular-mocks` which is only used during
development) come in two flavors — one suitable for development, the other for production:

* __`<filename>.js`__ — These files are non-obfuscated, non-minified, and human-readable by opening
  them in any editor or browser. In order to get better error messages during development, you
  should always use these non-minified scripts.

* __`<filename>.min.js`__ — These are minified and obfuscated versions, created with the
  [Closure compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/). Use these versions for
  production in order to minimize the size of the application that is downloaded by your user's
  browser.

* __`<filename>.min.js.map`__ — These are
  [sourcemap files](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/). You can
  serve them alongside the `.min.js` files in order to be able to debug the minified code (e.g. on a
  production deployment) more easily, but without impacting performance.

<br />
The set of files included in each version directory are:

* __`angular.zip`__ — This is a zip archive that contains all of the files released for this AngularJS
  version. Use this file to get everything in a single download.

* __`angular.js`__ — The core AngularJS framework. This is all you need to get your AngularJS app
  running.

* __`angular-csp.css`__ — You only need this file if you are using
  [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP). See
  {@link directive:ngCsp here} for more info.

* __`angular-mocks.js`__ — This file contains an implementation of mocks that makes testing angular
  apps even easier. Your unit/integration test harness should load this file after `angular.js` is
  loaded.

* __`angular-loader.js`__ — Module loader for AngularJS modules. If you are loading multiple
  script files containing AngularJS modules, you can load them asynchronously and in any order as long
  as you load this file first. Often the contents of this file are copy&pasted into the `index.html`
  to avoid even the initial request to `angular-loader[.min].js`.
  See [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/app/index-async.html) for
  an example of usage.

* __Additional AngularJS modules:__ Optional modules with additional functionality. These files
  should be loaded after the core `angular[.min].js` file:
  * __`angular-animate.js`__ — Enable animation support. ({@link module:ngAnimate API docs})
  * __`angular-aria.js`__ — Make your apps [accessible](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) to users of
      assistive technologies. ({@link module:ngAria API docs})
  * __`angular-cookies.js`__ — A convenient wrapper for reading and writing browser cookies.
      ({@link module:ngCookies API docs})
  * __`angular-message-format.js`__ — Enhanced support for pluralization and gender specific
      messages in interpolated text. ({@link module:ngMessageFormat API docs})
  * __`angular-messages.js`__ — Enhanced support for displaying validation messages.
      ({@link module:ngMessages API docs})
  * __`angular-parse-ext.js`__ — Allow Unicode characters in identifiers inside AngularJS expressions.
      ({@link module:ngParseExt API docs})
  * __`angular-resource.js`__ — Easy interaction with RESTful services.

# FAQ

## Questions

### Why is this project called "AngularJS"? Why is the namespace called "ng"?

Because HTML has angular brackets and "ng" sounds like "AngularJS".


### Is AngularJS a library, framework, plugin or a browser extension?

AngularJS fits the definition of a framework the best, even though it's much more lightweight than
a typical framework and that's why many confuse it with a library.

AngularJS is 100% JavaScript, 100% client-side and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers.
So it's definitely not a plugin or some other native browser extension.


### What is the AngularJS versioning strategy?

In AngularJS we do not allow intentional breaking changes to appear in versions where only the "patch"
number changes. For example between 1.3.12 and 1.3.13 there can be no breaking changes. We do allow
breaking changes happen between "minor" number changes. For example between 1.3.15 and 1.4.0 there
are a number of breaking changes. That means AngularJS does not follow
[semantic versioning (semver)](http://semver.org/) where breaking changes are only
allowed when the "major" version changes.

We also allow breaking changes between beta releases of AngularJS.
For example between 1.4.0-beta.4 and 1.4.0-beta.5 there may be breaking changes. We try hard to minimize
these kinds of change only to those where there is a strong use case such as a strongly requested feature
improvement, a considerable simplification of the code, a measurable performance improvement, or a better
developer experience (especially with regard to upgrading to Angular).

When we are making a release we generate updates to the changelog directly from the commits. This
generated update contains a highlighted section that contains all the breaking changes that have been
extracted from the commits. We can quickly see in the new changelog exactly what commits contain breaking
changes and so can application developers when they are deciding whether to update to a new version of
AngularJS.

Features with non-breaking changes can also appear in the "patch" version, e.g. in version 1.6.3 there might
be a feature that is not available in 1.6.2.

Finally, deprecation of features might also appear in "minor" version updates. That means the features
will still work in this version, but sometimes must be activated specifically.

#### When are deprecated features removed from the library?

Most of the time we remove a deprecated feature in a next minor version bump. For example, the
`preAssignBindingsEnabled` `$compileProvider` method was defined in AngularJS `1.5.10`, deprecated in `1.6` and
will be removed in `1.7`.

In case of jqLite we apply a different strategy - we deprecate features that have an equivalent in jQuery that
is also deprecated but we only remove the feature once it's removed from jQuery to improve compatibility between
jqLite and jQuery. One such example is the `bind` method, deprecated in favor of `on` but unlikely to be removed
from jqLite any time soon.

#### What is the version compatibility between AngularJS main and optional modules?

AngularJS code is separated into a main module ("angular"), and a few different optional modules
("angular-animate", "angular-route" etc) that are dependant on the main module.
When a new AngularJS version is released, all modules are updated to the new version.
This means that the main module and the optional modules must always have the exact same version,
down to the patch number, otherwise your application might break.

Therefore you must always explicitly lock down your dependencies, for example in the package.json,
the following means that "angular" and "angular-animate" are always updated to the same version:

```
{
  "angular": "~1.6.0",
  "angular-animate": "~1.6.0"
}
```

If you define exact versions, make sure core and optional modules are the same:

```
{
  "angular": "1.6.3",
  "angular-animate": "1.6.3"
}
```


#### How does AngularJS ensure code quality and guard against regressions?

When adding new code to AngularJS, we have a very stringent commit policy:

- Every commit must pass all existing tests, contain tests for code changes, and update the documentation
- Commit messages must be written in a specific manner that allows us to parse them and extract the changes
for release notes ([see the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))

The AngularJS code base has a very large set of unit tests and end-to-end tests. This means that a breaking change will require one or more tests to be changed to allow the
tests to pass. So when a commit includes tests that are being removed or modified, this is a flag that the
code might include a breaking change. When reviewing the commit we can then decide whether there really is
a breaking change and if it is appropriate for the branch to which it is being merged. If so, then we
require that the commit message contains an appropriate breaking change message.

Additionally, commits are periodically synced to Google where we test it against applications using
the test suites of these applications. This allows us to catch regressions
quickly before a release. We've had a pretty good experience with this setup. Only bugs that affect features
not used at Google or without sufficient test coverage, have a chance of making it through.


### Is AngularJS a templating system?

At the highest level, AngularJS does look like just another templating system. But there is one
important reason why the AngularJS templating system is different, that makes it very good fit for
application development: bidirectional data binding. The template is compiled in the browser and
the compilation step produces a live view. This means you, the developers, don't need to write
code to constantly sync the view with the model and the model with the view as in other
templating systems.


### Do I need to worry about security holes in AngularJS?

Like any other technology, AngularJS is not impervious to attack. AngularJS does, however, provide
built-in protection from basic security holes, including cross-site scripting and HTML injection
attacks. AngularJS does round-trip escaping on all strings for you and even offers XSRF protection
for server-side communication.

AngularJS was designed to be compatible with other security measures like Content Security Policy
(CSP), HTTPS (SSL/TLS) and server-side authentication and authorization that greatly reduce the
possible attack vectors and we highly recommend their use.

Please read {@link security} for more detailed information about securing AngularJS apps.


### Can I download the source, build, and host the AngularJS environment locally?

Yes. See instructions in {@link downloading}.



### What browsers does AngularJS work with?

We run our extensive test suite against the following browsers: the latest versions of Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, and Safari for iOS, as well as Internet Explorer versions 9-11. See
{@link guide/ie Internet Explorer Compatibility} for more details on supporting legacy IE browsers.

If a browser is untested, it doesn't mean it won't work. You can also expect browsers to work that
share a large part of their codebase with a browser we test, such as Opera 15 or newer
(uses the Blink engine), or the various Firefox derivatives.


### What's AngularJS's performance like?

The startup time heavily depends on your network connection, state of the cache, browser used and
available hardware, but typically we measure bootstrap time in tens or hundreds of milliseconds.

The runtime performance will vary depending on the number and complexity of bindings on the page
as well as the speed of your backend (for apps that fetch data from the backend). For an
illustration, we typically build snappy apps with hundreds or thousands of active bindings.


### How big is the angular.js file that I need to include?

The size of the file is ~50KB compressed and minified.


### Can I use the open-source Closure Library with AngularJS?

Yes, you can use widgets from the [Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/)
in AngularJS.


### Does AngularJS use the jQuery library?

Yes, AngularJS can use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) if it's present in your app when the
application is being bootstrapped. If jQuery is not present in your script path, AngularJS falls back
to its own implementation of the subset of jQuery that we call {@link angular.element  jQLite}.

For AngularJS 1.8 we support jQuery 2.1+ but we suggest jQuery 3.5.1 or above to avoid a potential
security issue. Earlier versions of jQuery might work correctly with AngularJS but we don't guarantee
that.


### What is testability like in AngularJS?

Very testable and designed this way from the ground up. It has an integrated dependency injection
framework, provides mocks for many heavy dependencies (server-side communication). See
{@link ngMock} for details.


### How can I learn more about AngularJS?

Watch the July 17, 2012 talk
"[AngularJS Intro + Dependency Injection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpiB3Wk25U)".


### How is AngularJS licensed?

The [MIT License](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Can I download and use the AngularJS logo artwork?

Yes! You can find design files in our github repository, under "[angular.js/images/logo](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/images/logo)"
The logo design is licensed under a "[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)". If you have some other use in mind, contact us.

### How can I get some AngularJS schwag?

We often bring a few t-shirts and stickers to events where we're presenting. If you want to order your own, the folks who
make our schwag will be happy to do a custom run for you, based on our existing template. By using the design they have on file,
they'll waive the setup costs, and you can order any quantity you need.

**Stickers**
For orders of 250 stickers or more within Canada or the United States, contact Tom Witting (or anyone in sales) via email at <tom@stickergiant.com>, and tell him you want to order some AngularJS
stickers just like the ones in job #42711. You'll have to give them your own info for billing and shipping.

As long as the design stays exactly the same, [StickerGiant](http://www.stickergiant.com) will give you a reorder discount.

For a smaller order, or for other countries, we suggest downloading the logo artwork and making your own.

## Common Pitfalls

The AngularJS support channel (#angularjs on Freenode) sees a number of recurring pitfalls that new users of AngularJS fall into.
This document aims to point them out before you discover them the hard way.

### DOM Manipulation

Stop trying to use jQuery to modify the DOM in controllers. Really.
That includes adding elements, removing elements, retrieving their contents, showing and hiding them.
Use built-in directives, or write your own where necessary, to do your DOM manipulation.
See below about duplicating functionality.

If you're struggling to break the habit, consider removing jQuery from your app.
Really. AngularJS has the $http service and powerful directives that make it almost always unnecessary.
AngularJS's bundled jQLite has a handful of the features most commonly used in writing AngularJS directives, especially binding to events.

### Trying to duplicate functionality that already exists

There's a good chance that your app isn't the first to require certain functionality.
There are a few pieces of AngularJS that are particularly likely to be reimplemented out of old habits.

**ng-repeat**

`ng-repeat` gets this a lot.
People try to use jQuery (see above) to add more elements to some container as they're fetched from the server.
No, bad dog.
This is what `ng-repeat` is for, and it does its job very well.
Store the data from the server in an array on your `$scope`, and bind it to the DOM with `ng-repeat`.

**ng-show**

`ng-show` gets this frequently too.
Conditionally showing and hiding things using jQuery is a common pattern in other apps, but AngularJS has a better way.
`ng-show` (and `ng-hide`) conditionally show and hide elements based on boolean expressions.
Describe the conditions for showing and hiding an element in terms of `$scope` variables:

    <div ng-show="!loggedIn"><a href="#/login">Click here to log in</a></div>

Note also the counterpart `ng-hide` and similar `ng-disabled`.
Note especially the powerful `ng-switch` that should be used instead of several mutually exclusive `ng-show`s.

**ng-class**

`ng-class` is the last of the big three.
Conditionally applying classes to elements is another thing commonly done manually using jQuery.
AngularJS, of course, has a better way.
You can give `ng-class` a whitespace-separated set of class names, and then it's identical to ordinary `class`.
That's not very exciting, so there's a second syntax:

    <div ng-class="{ errorClass: isError, warningClass: isWarning, okClass: !isError && !isWarning }">...</div>

Where you give `ng-class` an object, whose keys are CSS class names and whose values are conditional expressions using `$scope` variables.
The element will then have all the classes whose conditions are truthy, and none of those whose conditions are falsy.

Note also the handy `ng-class-even` and `ng-class-odd`, and the related though somewhat different `ng-style`.


### `$watch` and `$apply`

AngularJS's two-way data binding is the root of all awesome in AngularJS.
However, it's not magic, and there are some situations where you need to give it a nudge in the right direction.

When you bind a value to an element in AngularJS using `ng-model`, `ng-repeat`, etc., AngularJS creates a `$watch` on that value.
Then whenever a value on a scope changes, all `$watch`es observing that element are executed, and everything updates.

Sometimes, usually when you're writing a custom directive, you will have to define your own `$watch` on a scope value to make the directive react to changes.

On the flip side, sometimes you change a scope value in some code, but the app doesn't react to it.
AngularJS checks for scope variable changes after pieces of your code have finished running; for example, when `ng-click` calls a function on your scope, AngularJS will check for changes and react.
However, some code is outside of AngularJS and you'll have to call `scope.$apply()` yourself to trigger the update.
This is most commonly seen in event handlers in custom directives.

### Combining `ng-repeat` with other directives

`ng-repeat` is extremely useful, one of the most powerful directives in AngularJS.
However the transformation it applies to the DOM is substantial.
Therefore applying other directives (such as `ng-show`, `ng-controller` and others) to the same element as `ng-repeat` generally leads to problems.

If you want to apply a directive to the whole repeat, wrap the repeat in a parent element and put it there.
If you want to apply a directive to each inner piece of the repeat, put it on a child of the element with `ng-repeat`.

### `$rootScope` exists, but it can be used for evil

Scopes in AngularJS form a hierarchy, prototypically inheriting from a root scope at the top of the tree.
Usually this can be ignored, since most views have a controller, and therefore a scope, of their own.

Occasionally there are pieces of data that you want to make global to the whole app.
For these, you can inject `$rootScope` and set values on it like any other scope.
Since the scopes inherit from the root scope, these values will be available to the expressions attached to directives like `ng-show` just like values on your local `$scope`.

Of course, global state sucks and you should use `$rootScope` sparingly, like you would (hopefully) use with global variables in any language.
In particular, don't use it for code, only data.
If you're tempted to put a function on `$rootScope`, it's almost always better to put it in a service that can be injected where it's needed, and more easily tested.

Conversely, don't create a service whose only purpose in life is to store and return bits of data.

## guide/$location.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name  Using $location
@sortOrder 500
@description

# Using the `$location` service

The `$location` service parses the URL in the browser address bar (based on [`window.location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.location)) and makes the URL available to
your application. Changes to the URL in the address bar are reflected into the `$location` service and
changes to `$location` are reflected into the browser address bar.

**The $location service:**

- Exposes the current URL in the browser address bar, so you can
  - Watch and observe the URL.
  - Change the URL.
- Maintains synchronization between itself and the browser's URL when the user
  - Changes the address in the browser's address bar.
  - Clicks the back or forward button in the browser (or clicks a History link).
  - Clicks on a link in the page.
- Represents the URL object as a set of methods (protocol, host, port, path, search, hash).

## When should I use `$location`?
Any time your application needs to react to a change in the current URL or if you want to change
the current URL in the browser.

## What does it not do?
It does not cause a full page reload when the browser URL is changed. To reload the page after
changing the URL, use the lower-level API, `$window.location.href`.

## General overview of the API

The `$location` service can behave differently, depending on the configuration that was provided to
it when it was instantiated. The default configuration is suitable for many applications, for
others customizing the configuration can enable new features.

Once the `$location` service is instantiated, you can interact with it via jQuery-style getter and
setter methods that allow you to get or change the current URL in the browser.

### `$location` service configuration

To configure the `$location` service, retrieve the
{@link ng.$locationProvider $locationProvider} and set the parameters as follows:


- **html5Mode(mode)**: `{boolean|Object}`<br />
  `false` or `{enabled: false}` (default) -
    see [Hashbang mode](guide/$location#hashbang-mode-default-mode-)<br />
  `true` or `{enabled: true}` -
    see [HTML5 mode](guide/$location#html5-mode)<br />
  `{..., requireBase: true/false}` (only affects HTML5 mode) -
    see [Relative links](guide/$location#relative-links)<br />
  `{..., rewriteLinks: true/false/'string'}` (only affects HTML5 mode) -
    see [HTML link rewriting](guide/$location#html-link-rewriting)<br />
  Default:
    ```j
    {
      enabled: false,
      requireBase: true,
      rewriteLinks: true
    }
    ```

- **hashPrefix(prefix)**: `{string}`<br />
  Prefix used for Hashbang URLs (used in Hashbang mode or in legacy browsers in HTML5 mode).<br />
  Default: `'!'`

#### Example configuration
```js
$locationProvider.html5Mode(true).hashPrefix('*');
```

### Getter and setter methods

`$location` service provides getter methods for read-only parts of the URL (absUrl, protocol, host,
port) and getter / setter methods for url, path, search, hash:
```js
// get the current path
$location.path();

// change the path
$location.path('/newValue')
```

All of the setter methods return the same `$location` object to allow chaining. For example, to
change multiple segments in one go, chain setters like this:

```js
$location.path('/newValue').search({key: value});
```

### Replace method

There is a special `replace` method which can be used to tell the $location service that the next
time the $location service is synced with the browser, the last history record should be replaced
instead of creating a new one. This is useful when you want to implement redirection, which would
otherwise break the back button (navigating back would retrigger the redirection). To change the
current URL without creating a new browser history record you can call:

```js
  $location.path('/someNewPath');
  $location.replace();
  // or you can chain these as: $location.path('/someNewPath').replace();
```

Note that the setters don't update `window.location` immediately. Instead, the `$location` service is
aware of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} life-cycle and coalesces multiple `$location`
mutations into one "commit" to the `window.location` object during the scope `$digest` phase. Since
multiple changes to the $location's state will be pushed to the browser as a single change, it's
enough to call the `replace()` method just once to make the entire "commit" a replace operation
rather than an addition to the browser history. Once the browser is updated, the $location service
resets the flag set by `replace()` method and future mutations will create new history records,
unless `replace()` is called again.

### Setters and character encoding
You can pass special characters to `$location` service and it will encode them according to rules
specified in [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). When you access the methods:

- All values that are passed to `$location` setter methods, `path()`, `search()`, `hash()`, are
encoded.
- Getters (calls to methods without parameters) return decoded values for the following methods
`path()`, `search()`, `hash()`.
- When you call the `absUrl()` method, the returned value is a full url with its segments encoded.
- When you call the `url()` method, the returned value is path, search and hash, in the form
`/path?search=a&b=c#hash`. The segments are encoded as well.


## Hashbang and HTML5 Modes

`$location` service has two configuration modes which control the format of the URL in the browser
address bar: **Hashbang mode** (the default) and the **HTML5 mode** which is based on using the
[HTML5 History API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#the-history-interface). Applications use the same API in
both modes and the `$location` service will work with appropriate URL segments and browser APIs to
facilitate the browser URL change and history management.

<table class="table">
<thead>

  <tr>
    <th class="empty-corner-lt"></th>
    <th>Hashbang mode</th>
    <th>HTML5 mode</th>
  </tr>

</thead>
<tbody>

  <tr>
    <td class="head">configuration</td>
    <td>the default</td>
    <td>{ html5Mode: true }</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="head">URL format</td>
    <td>hashbang URLs in all browsers</td>

    <td>no</td>
    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="head">requires server-side configuration</td>
    <td>no</td>
    <td>yes</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Hashbang mode (default mode)

In this mode, `$location` uses Hashbang URLs in all browsers.
AngularJS also does not intercept and rewrite links in this mode. I.e. links work
as expected and also perform full page reloads when other parts of the url
than the hash fragment was changed.


#### Example

```js
it('should show example', function() {
  module(function($locationProvider) {
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(false);
    $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
  });
  inject(function($location) {
    // open http://example.com/base/index.html#!/a
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/base/index.html#!/a');
    expect($location.path()).toBe('/a');

    $location.path('/foo');
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/base/index.html#!/foo');

    expect($location.search()).toEqual({});
    $location.search({a: 'b', c: true});
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/base/index.html#!/foo?a=b&c');

    $location.path('/new').search('x=y');
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/base/index.html#!/new?x=y');
  });
});
```

### HTML5 mode

In HTML5 mode, the `$location` service getters and setters interact with the browser URL address
through the HTML5 history API. This allows for use of regular URL path and search segments,
instead of their hashbang equivalents. If the HTML5 History API is not supported by a browser, the
`$location` service will fall back to using the hashbang URLs automatically. This frees you from
having to worry about whether the browser displaying your app supports the history API  or not; the
`$location` service transparently uses the best available option.

- Opening a regular URL in a legacy browser -> redirects to a hashbang URL
- Opening hashbang URL in a modern browser -> rewrites to a regular URL

Note that in this mode, AngularJS intercepts all links (subject to the "Html link rewriting" rules below)
and updates the url in a way that never performs a full page reload.


#### Example

```js
it('should show example', function() {
  module(function($locationProvider) {
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
    $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
  });
  inject(function($location) {
    // in browser with HTML5 history support:
    // open http://example.com/#!/a -> rewrite to http://example.com/a
    // (replacing the http://example.com/#!/a history record)
    expect($location.path()).toBe('/a');

    $location.path('/foo');
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/foo');

    expect($location.search()).toEqual({});
    $location.search({a: 'b', c: true});
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/foo?a=b&c');

    $location.path('/new').search('x=y');
    expect($location.url()).toBe('/new?x=y');
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/new?x=y');
  });
});

it('should show example (when browser doesn\'t support HTML5 mode', function() {
  module(function($provide, $locationProvider) {
    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
    $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
    $provide.value('$sniffer', {history: false});
  });
  inject(initBrowser({ url: 'http://example.com/new?x=y', basePath: '/' }),
    function($location) {
    // in browser without html5 history support:
    // open http://example.com/new?x=y -> redirect to http://example.com/#!/new?x=y
    // (again replacing the http://example.com/new?x=y history item)
    expect($location.path()).toBe('/new');
    expect($location.search()).toEqual({x: 'y'});

    $location.path('/foo/bar');
    expect($location.path()).toBe('/foo/bar');
    expect($location.url()).toBe('/foo/bar?x=y');
    expect($location.absUrl()).toBe('http://example.com/#!/foo/bar?x=y');
  });
});
```

#### Fallback for legacy browsers

For browsers that support the HTML5 history API, `$location` uses the HTML5 history API to write
path and search. If the history API is not supported by a browser, `$location` supplies a Hashbang
URL. This frees you from having to worry about whether the browser viewing your app supports the
history API  or not; the `$location` service makes this transparent to you.

#### HTML link rewriting

When you use HTML5 history API mode, you will not need special hashbang links. All you have to do
is specify regular URL links, such as: `<a href="/some?foo=bar">link</a>`

When a user clicks on this link,

- In a legacy browser, the URL changes to `/index.html#!/some?foo=bar`
- In a modern browser, the URL changes to `/some?foo=bar`


In cases like the following, links are not rewritten; instead, the browser will perform a full page
reload to the original link.

- Links that contain `target` element<br>
  Example: `<a href="/ext/link?a=b" target="_self">link</a>`
- Absolute links that go to a different domain<br>
  Example: `<a href="http://angularjs.org/">link</a>`
- Links starting with '/' that lead to a different base path<br>
  Example: `<a href="/not-my-base/link">link</a>`

If `mode.rewriteLinks` is set to `false` in the `mode` configuration object passed to
`$locationProvider.html5Mode()`, the browser will perform a full page reload for every link.
`mode.rewriteLinks` can also be set to a string, which will enable link rewriting only on anchor
elements that have the given attribute.

For example, if `mode.rewriteLinks` is set to `'internal-link'`:
- `<a href="/some/path" internal-link>link</a>` will be rewritten
- `<a href="/some/path">link</a>` will perform a full page reload

Note that [attribute name normalization](guide/directive#normalization) does not apply here, so
`'internalLink'` will **not** match `'internal-link'`.


#### Relative links

Be sure to check all relative links, images, scripts etc. AngularJS requires you to specify the url
base in the head of your main html file (`<base href="/my-base/index.html">`) unless `html5Mode.requireBase`
is set to `false` in the html5Mode definition object passed to `$locationProvider.html5Mode()`. With
that, relative urls will always be resolved to this base url, even if the initial url of the
document was different.

There is one exception: Links that only contain a hash fragment (e.g. `<a href="#target">`)
will only change `$location.hash()` and not modify the url otherwise. This is useful for scrolling
to anchors on the same page without needing to know on which page the user currently is.


#### Server side

Using this mode requires URL rewriting on server side, basically you have to rewrite all your links
to entry point of your application (e.g. index.html). Requiring a `<base>` tag is also important for
this case, as it allows AngularJS to differentiate between the part of the url that is the application
base and the path that should be handled by the application.

#### Base href constraints

The `$location` service is not able to function properly if the current URL is outside the URL given
as the base href. This can have subtle confusing consequences...

Consider a base href set as follows: `<base href="/base/">` (i.e. the application exists in the "folder"
called `/base`). The URL `/base` is actually outside the application (it refers to the `base` file found
in the root `/` folder).

If you wish to be able to navigate to the application via a URL such as `/base` then you should ensure that
your server is setup to redirect such requests to `/base/`.

See https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/14018 for more information.

### Sending links among different browsers

Because of rewriting capability in HTML5 mode, your users will be able to open regular url links in
legacy browsers and hashbang links in modern browser:

- Modern browser will rewrite hashbang URLs to regular URLs.
- Older browsers will redirect regular URLs to hashbang URLs.

#### Example

Here you can see two `$location` instances that show the difference between **Html5 mode** and **Html5 Fallback mode**.
Note that to simulate different levels of browser support, the `$location` instances are connected to
a fakeBrowser service, which you don't have to set up in actual projects.

Note that when you type hashbang url into the first browser (or vice versa) it doesn't rewrite /
redirect to regular / hashbang url, as this conversion happens only during parsing the initial URL
= on page reload.

In these examples we use `<base href="/base/index.html" />`. The inputs represent the address bar of the browser.

## Caveats

### Page reload navigation

The `$location` service allows you to change only the URL; it does not allow you to reload the
page. When you need to change the URL and reload the page or navigate to a different page, please
use a lower level API, {@link ng.$window $window.location.href}.

### Using $location outside of the scope life-cycle

`$location` knows about AngularJS's {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} life-cycle. When a URL changes in
the browser it updates the `$location` and calls `$apply` so that all
{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watchers} /
{@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes#$observe $observers} are notified.
When you change the `$location` inside the `$digest` phase everything is ok; `$location` will
propagate this change into browser and will notify all the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watchers} /
{@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes#$observe $observers}.
When you want to change the `$location` from outside AngularJS (for example, through a DOM Event or
during testing) - you must call `$apply` to propagate the changes.

### $location.path() and ! or / prefixes

A path should always begin with forward slash (`/`); the `$location.path()` setter will add the
forward slash if it is missing.

Note that the `!` prefix in the hashbang mode is not part of `$location.path()`; it is actually
`hashPrefix`.

### Crawling your app

Most modern search engines are able to crawl AJAX applications with dynamic content, provided all
included resources are available to the crawler bots.

There also exists a special
[AJAX crawling scheme](http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/specification.html) developed by
Google that allows bots to crawl the static equivalent of a dynamically generated page,
but this schema has been deprecated, and support for it may vary by search engine.

## Testing with the $location service

When using `$location` service during testing, you are outside of the angular's {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} life-cycle. This means it's your responsibility to call `scope.$apply()`.

```js
describe('serviceUnderTest', function() {
  beforeEach(module(function($provide) {
    $provide.factory('serviceUnderTest', function($location) {
      // whatever it does...
    });
  });

  it('should...', inject(function($location, $rootScope, serviceUnderTest) {
    $location.path('/new/path');
    $rootScope.$apply();

    // test whatever the service should do...

  }));
});
```

## Two-way binding to $location

Because `$location` uses getters/setters, you can use `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"`
to bind it to `ngModel`:

<example module="locationExample" name="location-two-way-binding">
<file name="index.html">
<div ng-controller="LocationController">
  <input type="text" ng-model="locationPath" ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }" />
</div>
</file>
<file name="script.js">
angular.module('locationExample', [])
  .controller('LocationController', ['$scope', '$location', function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.locationPath = function(newLocation) {
      return $location.path(newLocation);
    };
  }]);
</file>
</example>

# Accessibility with ngAria

The goal of ngAria is to improve AngularJS's default accessibility by enabling common
[ARIA](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) attributes that convey state or semantic information for
assistive technologies used by persons with disabilities.

## Including ngAria

Using {@link ngAria ngAria} is as simple as requiring the ngAria module in your application. ngAria hooks into
standard AngularJS directives and quietly injects accessibility support into your application
at runtime.

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['ngAria'])...
```

### Using ngAria
Most of what ngAria does is only visible "under the hood". To see the module in action, once you've
added it as a dependency, you can test a few things:
 * Using your favorite element inspector, look for attributes added by ngAria in your own code.
 * Test using your keyboard to ensure `tabindex` is used correctly.
 * Fire up a screen reader such as VoiceOver or NVDA to check for ARIA support.
[Helpful screen reader tips.](http://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/)

## Supported directives
Currently, ngAria interfaces with the following directives:

 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngmodel ngModel}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngdisabled ngDisabled}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngrequired ngRequired}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngreadonly ngReadonly}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngvaluechecked ngChecked}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngvaluechecked ngValue}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngshow ngShow}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#nghide ngHide}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngclick ngClick}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngdblclick ngDblClick}
 * {@link guide/accessibility#ngmessages ngMessages}

<h2 id="ngmodel">ngModel</h2>

Much of ngAria's heavy lifting happens in the {@link ng.ngModel ngModel}
directive. For elements using ngModel, special attention is paid by ngAria if that element also
has a role or type of `checkbox`, `radio`, `range` or `textbox`.

For those elements using ngModel, ngAria will dynamically bind and update the following ARIA
attributes (if they have not been explicitly specified by the developer):

 * aria-checked
 * aria-valuemin
 * aria-valuemax
 * aria-valuenow
 * aria-invalid
 * aria-required
 * aria-readonly
 * aria-disabled

</example>

ngAria will also add `tabIndex`, ensuring custom elements with these roles will be reachable from
the keyboard. It is still up to **you** as a developer to **ensure custom controls will be
accessible**. As a rule, any time you create a widget involving user interaction, be sure to test
it with your keyboard and at least one mobile and desktop screen reader.

<h2 id="ngvaluechecked">ngValue and ngChecked</h2>

To ease the transition between native inputs and custom controls, ngAria now supports
{@link ng.ngValue ngValue} and {@link ng.ngChecked ngChecked}.
The original directives were created for native inputs only, so ngAria extends
support to custom elements by managing `aria-checked` for accessibility.

### Example

```html
<custom-checkbox ng-checked="val"></custom-checkbox>
<custom-radio-button ng-value="val"></custom-radio-button>
```

Becomes:

```html
<custom-checkbox ng-checked="val" aria-checked="true"></custom-checkbox>
<custom-radio-button ng-value="val" aria-checked="true"></custom-radio-button>
```

<h2 id="ngdisabled">ngDisabled</h2>

The `disabled` attribute is only valid for certain elements such as `button`, `input` and
`textarea`. To properly disable custom element directives such as `<md-checkbox>` or `<taco-tab>`,
using ngAria with {@link ng.ngDisabled ngDisabled} will also
add `aria-disabled`. This tells assistive technologies when a non-native input is disabled, helping
custom controls to be more accessible.

### Example

```html
<md-checkbox ng-disabled="disabled"></md-checkbox>
```

Becomes:

```html
<md-checkbox disabled aria-disabled="true"></md-checkbox>
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
You can check whether a control is legitimately disabled for a screen reader by visiting
[chrome://accessibility](chrome://accessibility) and inspecting [the accessibility tree](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/the-browser-accessibility-tree/).
</div>

<h2 id="ngrequired">ngRequired</h2>

The boolean `required` attribute is only valid for native form controls such as `input` and
`textarea`. To properly indicate custom element directives such as `<md-checkbox>` or `<custom-input>`
as required, using ngAria with {@link ng.ngRequired ngRequired} will also add
`aria-required`. This tells accessibility APIs when a custom control is required.

### Example

```html
<md-checkbox ng-required="val"></md-checkbox>
```

Becomes:

```html
<md-checkbox ng-required="val" aria-required="true"></md-checkbox>
```

<h2 id="ngreadonly">ngReadonly</h2>

The boolean `readonly` attribute is only valid for native form controls such as `input` and
`textarea`. To properly indicate custom element directives such as `<md-checkbox>` or `<custom-input>`
as required, using ngAria with {@link ng.ngReadonly ngReadonly} will also add
`aria-readonly`. This tells accessibility APIs when a custom control is read-only.

### Example

```html
<md-checkbox ng-readonly="val"></md-checkbox>
```

Becomes:

```html
<md-checkbox ng-readonly="val" aria-readonly="true"></md-checkbox>
```

<h2 id="ngshow">ngShow</h2>

The {@link ng.ngShow ngShow} directive shows or hides the
given HTML element based on the expression provided to the `ngShow` attribute. The element is
shown or hidden by removing or adding the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element.

In its default setup, ngAria for `ngShow` is actually redundant. It toggles `aria-hidden` on the
directive when it is hidden or shown. However, the default CSS of `display: none !important`,
already hides child elements from a screen reader. It becomes more useful when the default
CSS is overridden with properties that don’t affect assistive technologies, such as `opacity`
or `transform`. By toggling `aria-hidden` dynamically with ngAria, we can ensure content visually
hidden with this technique will not be read aloud in a screen reader.

One caveat with this combination of CSS and `aria-hidden`: you must also remove links and other
interactive child elements from the tab order using `tabIndex=“-1”` on each control. This ensures
screen reader users won't accidentally focus on "mystery elements". Managing tab index on every
child control can be complex and affect performance, so it’s best to just stick with the default
`display: none` CSS. See the [fourth rule of ARIA use](http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/#fourth-rule-of-aria-use).

### Example
```css
.ng-hide {
  display: block;
  opacity: 0;
}
```
```html
<div ng-show="false" class="ng-hide" aria-hidden="true"></div>
```

Becomes:

```html
<div ng-show="true" aria-hidden="false"></div>
```
*Note: Child links, buttons or other interactive controls must also be removed from the tab order.*

<h2 id="nghide">ngHide</h2>

The {@link ng.ngHide ngHide} directive shows or hides the
given HTML element based on the expression provided to the `ngHide` attribute. The element is
shown or hidden by removing or adding the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element.

The default CSS for `ngHide`, the inverse method to `ngShow`, makes ngAria redundant. It toggles
`aria-hidden` on the directive when it is hidden or shown, but the content is already hidden with
`display: none`. See explanation for {@link guide/accessibility#ngshow ngShow} when overriding the default CSS.

<h2><span id="ngclick">ngClick</span> and <span id="ngdblclick">ngDblclick</span></h2>
If `ng-click` or `ng-dblclick` is encountered, ngAria will add `tabindex="0"` to any element not in
the list of built in aria nodes:

 * Button
 * Anchor
 * Input
 * Textarea
 * Select
 * Details/Summary

To fix widespread accessibility problems with `ng-click` on `div` elements, ngAria will
dynamically bind a keypress event by default as long as the element isn't in a node from the list of
built in aria nodes.
You can turn this functionality on or off with the `bindKeypress` configuration option.

ngAria will also add the `button` role to communicate to users of assistive technologies. This can
be disabled with the `bindRoleForClick` configuration option.

For `ng-dblclick`, you must still manually add `ng-keypress` and a role to non-interactive elements
such as `div` or `taco-button` to enable keyboard access.

<h3>Example</h3>
```html
<div ng-click="toggleMenu()"></div>
```

Becomes:
```html
<div ng-click="toggleMenu()" tabindex="0"></div>
```

<h2 id="ngmessages">ngMessages</h2>

The ngMessages module makes it easy to display form validation or other messages with priority
sequencing and animation. To expose these visual messages to screen readers,
ngAria injects `aria-live="assertive"`, causing them to be read aloud any time a message is shown,
regardless of the user's focus location.
### Example

```html
<div ng-messages="myForm.myName.$error">
  <div ng-message="required">You did not enter a field</div>
  <div ng-message="maxlength">Your field is too long</div>
</div>
```

Becomes:

```html
<div ng-messages="myForm.myName.$error" aria-live="assertive">
  <div ng-message="required">You did not enter a field</div>
  <div ng-message="maxlength">Your field is too long</div>
</div>
```

## Disabling attributes
The attribute magic of ngAria may not work for every scenario. To disable individual attributes,
you can use the {@link ngAria.$ariaProvider#config config} method. Just keep in mind this will
tell ngAria to ignore the attribute globally.

<example module="ngAria_ngClickExample" deps="angular-aria.js" name="accessibility-ng-click">
 <file name="index.html">
  <div ng-click="someFunction" show-attrs>
    &lt;div&gt; with ng-click and bindRoleForClick, tabindex set to false
  </div>
 <script>
  angular.module('ngAria_ngClickExample', ['ngAria'], function config($ariaProvider) {
    $ariaProvider.config({
      bindRoleForClick: false,
      tabindex: false
    });
  })
  .directive('showAttrs', function() {
    return function(scope, el, attrs) {
      var pre = document.createElement('pre');
      el.after(pre);
      scope.$watch(function() {
        var attrs = {};
        Array.prototype.slice.call(el[0].attributes, 0).forEach(function(item) {
          if (item.name !== 'show-attrs') {
            attrs[item.name] = item.value;
          }
        });
        return attrs;
      }, function(newAttrs, oldAttrs) {
        pre.textContent = JSON.stringify(newAttrs, null, 2);
      }, true);
    }
  });
 </script>
 </file>
</example>

## Common Accessibility Patterns

Accessibility best practices that apply to web apps in general also apply to AngularJS.

 * **Text alternatives**: Add alternate text content to make visual information accessible using
 [these W3C guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-alt-techniques/). The appropriate technique
 depends on the specific markup but can be accomplished using offscreen spans, `aria-label` or
 label elements, image `alt` attributes, `figure`/`figcaption` elements and more.
 * **HTML Semantics**: If you're creating custom element directives, Web Components or HTML in
 general, use native elements wherever possible to utilize built-in events and properties.
 Alternatively, use ARIA to communicate semantic meaning. See [notes on ARIA use](http://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/#notes-on-aria-use-in-html).
 * **Focus management**: Guide the user around the app as views are appended/removed.
 Focus should *never* be lost, as this causes unexpected behavior and much confusion (referred to
 as "freak-out mode").
 * **Announcing changes**: When filtering or other UI messaging happens away from the user's focus,
 notify with [ARIA Live Regions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).
 * **Color contrast and scale**: Make sure content is legible and interactive controls are usable
 at all screen sizes. Consider configurable UI themes for people with color blindness, low vision
 or other visual impairments.
 * **Progressive enhancement**: Some users do not browse with JavaScript enabled or do not have
 the latest browser. An accessible message about site requirements can inform users and improve
 the experience.

# Animations

AngularJS provides animation hooks for common directives such as
{@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat}, {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch ngSwitch}, and
{@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}, as well as custom directives via the `$animate` service.
These animation hooks are set in place to trigger animations during the life cycle of various
directives and when triggered, will attempt to perform a CSS Transition, CSS Keyframe Animation or a
JavaScript callback Animation (depending on whether an animation is placed on the given directive).
Animations can be placed using vanilla CSS by following the naming conventions set in place by
AngularJS or with JavaScript code, defined as a factory.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note that we have used non-prefixed CSS transition properties in our examples as the major
  browsers now support non-prefixed properties. If you intend to support older browsers or certain
  mobile browsers then you will need to include prefixed versions of the transition properties. Take
  a look at http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions for what browsers require prefixes, and
  https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer for a tool that can automatically generate the prefixes
  for you.
</div>

Animations are not available unless you include the {@link ngAnimate `ngAnimate` module} as a
dependency of your application.

Below is a quick example of animations being enabled for `ngShow` and `ngHide`:

<example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" name="animate-ng-show">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-init="checked = true">
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" ng-model="checked" />
        Is visible
      </label>
      <div class="content-area sample-show-hide" ng-show="checked">
        Content...
      </div>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="animations.css">
    .content-area {
      border: 1px solid black;
      margin-top: 10px;
      padding: 10px;
    }

    .sample-show-hide {
      transition: all linear 0.5s;
    }
    .sample-show-hide.ng-hide {
      opacity: 0;
    }
  </file>
</example>

## Installation

See the {@link ngAnimate API docs for `ngAnimate`} for instructions on installing the module.

You may also want to setup a separate CSS file for defining CSS-based animations.

## How they work

Animations in AngularJS are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class
attached to an HTML element within your application, you can apply animations to it. Let's say for
example that we have an HTML template with a repeater like so:

```html
<div ng-repeat="item in items" class="repeated-item">
  {{ item.id }}
</div>
```

As you can see, the `repeated-item` class is present on the element that will be repeated and this
class will be used as a reference within our application's CSS and/or JavaScript animation code to
tell AngularJS to perform an animation.

As `ngRepeat` does its thing, each time a new item is added into the list, `ngRepeat` will add an
`ng-enter` class to the element that is being added. When removed it will apply an `ng-leave` class
and when moved around it will apply an `ng-move` class.

Taking a look at the following CSS code, we can see some transition and keyframe animation code set
up for each of those events that occur when `ngRepeat` triggers them:

```css
/*
  We are using CSS transitions for when the enter and move events
  are triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter, .repeated-item.ng-move {
  transition: all 0.5s linear;
  opacity: 0;
}

/*
  `.ng-enter-active` and `.ng-move-active` are where the transition destination
  properties are set so that the animation knows what to animate
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter.ng-enter-active,
.repeated-item.ng-move.ng-move-active {
  opacity: 1;
}

/*
  We are using CSS keyframe animations for when the `leave` event
  is triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-leave {
  animation: 0.5s my_animation;
}

@keyframes my_animation {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to   { opacity: 0; }
}
```

The same approach to animation can be used using JavaScript code
(**for simplicity, we rely on jQuery to perform animations here**):

```js
myModule.animation('.repeated-item', function() {
  return {
    enter: function(element, done) {
      // Initialize the element's opacity
      element.css('opacity', 0);

      // Animate the element's opacity
      // (`element.animate()` is provided by jQuery)
      element.animate({opacity: 1}, done);

      // Optional `onDone`/`onCancel` callback function
      // to handle any post-animation cleanup operations
      return function(isCancelled) {
        if (isCancelled) {
          // Abort the animation if cancelled
          // (`element.stop()` is provided by jQuery)
          element.stop();
        }
      };
    },
    leave: function(element, done) {
      // Initialize the element's opacity
      element.css('opacity', 1);

      // Animate the element's opacity
      // (`element.animate()` is provided by jQuery)
      element.animate({opacity: 0}, done);

      // Optional `onDone`/`onCancel` callback function
      // to handle any post-animation cleanup operations
      return function(isCancelled) {
        if (isCancelled) {
          // Abort the animation if cancelled
          // (`element.stop()` is provided by jQuery)
          element.stop();
        }
      };
    },

    // We can also capture the following animation events:
    move: function(element, done) {},
    addClass: function(element, className, done) {},
    removeClass: function(element, className, done) {}
  }
});
```

With these generated CSS class names present on the element at the time, AngularJS automatically
figures out whether to perform a CSS and/or JavaScript animation. Note that you can't have both CSS
and JavaScript animations based on the same CSS class. See
{@link ngAnimate#css-js-animations-together here} for more details.

## Class and `ngClass` animation hooks

AngularJS also pays attention to CSS class changes on elements by triggering the **add** and
**remove** hooks. This means that if a CSS class is added to or removed from an element then an
animation can be executed in between, before the CSS class addition or removal is finalized.
(Keep in mind that AngularJS will only be able to capture class changes if an
**interpolated expression** or the **ng-class** directive is used on the element.)

The example below shows how to perform animations during class changes:

<example module="ngAnimate" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" name="animate-css-class">
  <file name="index.html">
    <p>
      <button ng-click="myCssVar='css-class'">Set</button>
      <button ng-click="myCssVar=''">Clear</button>
      <br>
      <span ng-class="myCssVar">CSS-Animated Text</span>
    </p>
  </file>
  <file name="style.css">
    .css-class-add, .css-class-remove {
      transition: all 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940);
    }

    .css-class,
    .css-class-add.css-class-add-active {
      color: red;
      font-size: 3em;
    }

    .css-class-remove.css-class-remove-active {
      font-size: 1em;
      color: black;
    }
  </file>
</example>

Although the CSS is a little different than what we saw before, the idea is the same.

## Which directives support animations?

A handful of common AngularJS directives support and trigger animation hooks whenever any major
event occurs during their life cycle. The table below explains in detail which animation events are
triggered:

| Directive                                                                     | Supported Animations                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {@link ng.directive:form#animations form / ngForm}                            | add and remove ({@link ng.directive:form#css-classes various classes})    |
| {@link ngAnimate.directive:ngAnimateSwap#animations ngAnimateSwap}            | enter and leave                                                           |
| {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass / {{class&#125;&#8203;&#125;}  | add and remove                                                            |
| {@link ng.directive:ngClassEven#animations ngClassEven}                       | add and remove                                                            |
| {@link ng.directive:ngClassOdd#animations ngClassOdd}                         | add and remove                                                            |
| {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}                                 | add and remove (the `ng-hide` class)                                      |
| {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                     | enter and leave                                                           |

(More information can be found by visiting the documentation associated with each directive.)

For a full breakdown of the steps involved during each animation event, refer to the
{@link ng.$animate `$animate` API docs}.

## How do I use animations in my own directives?

Animations within custom directives can also be established by injecting `$animate` directly into
your directive and making calls to it when needed.

```js
myModule.directive('my-directive', ['$animate', function($animate) {
  return function(scope, element) {
    element.on('click', function() {
      if (element.hasClass('clicked')) {
        $animate.removeClass(element, 'clicked');
      } else {
        $animate.addClass(element, 'clicked');
      }
    });
  };
}]);
```

## Animations on app bootstrap / page load

By default, animations are disabled when the AngularJS app {@link guide/bootstrap bootstraps}. If you
are using the {@link ngApp} directive, this happens in the `DOMContentLoaded` event, so immediately
after the page has been loaded. Animations are disabled, so that UI and content are instantly
visible. Otherwise, with many animations on the page, the loading process may become too visually
overwhelming, and the performance may suffer.

Internally, `ngAnimate` waits until all template downloads that are started right after bootstrap
have finished. Then, it waits for the currently running {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest}
and one more after that, to finish. This ensures that the whole app has been compiled fully before
animations are attempted.

If you do want your animations to play when the app bootstraps, you can enable animations globally
in your main module's {@link angular.Module#run run} function:

```js
myModule.run(function($animate) {
  $animate.enabled(true);
});
```

## How to (selectively) enable, disable and skip animations

There are several different ways to disable animations, both globally and for specific animations.
Disabling specific animations can help to speed up the render performance, for example for large
`ngRepeat` lists that don't actually have animations. Because `ngAnimate` checks at runtime if
animations are present, performance will take a hit even if an element has no animation.

### During the config: {@link $animateProvider#customFilter $animateProvider.customFilter()}

This function can be called during the {@link angular.Module#config config} phase of an app. It
takes a filter function as the only argument, which will then be used to "filter" animations (based
on the animated element, the event type, and the animation options). Only when the filter function
returns `true`, will the animation be performed. This allows great flexibility - you can easily
create complex rules, such as allowing specific events only or enabling animations on specific
subtrees of the DOM, and dynamically modify them, for example disabling animations at certain points
in time or under certain circumstances.

```js
app.config(function($animateProvider) {
  $animateProvider.customFilter(function(node, event, options) {
    // Example: Only animate `enter` and `leave` operations.
    return event === 'enter' || event === 'leave';
  });
});
```

The `customFilter` approach generally gives a big speed boost compared to other strategies, because
the matching is done before other animation disabling strategies are checked.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  **Best Practice:**
  Keep the filtering function as lean as possible, because it will be called for each DOM
  action (e.g. insertion, removal, class change) performed by "animation-aware" directives.
  See {@link guide/animations#which-directives-support-animations- here} for a list of built-in
  directives that support animations.
  Performing computationally expensive or time-consuming operations on each call of the
  filtering function can make your animations sluggish.
</div>

### During the config: {@link $animateProvider#classNameFilter $animateProvider.classNameFilter()}

This function too can be called during the {@link angular.Module#config config} phase of an app. It
takes a regex as the only argument, which will then be matched against the classes of any element
that is about to be animated. The regex allows a lot of flexibility - you can either allow
animations for specific classes only (useful when you are working with 3rd party animations), or
exclude specific classes from getting animated.

```js
app.config(function($animateProvider) {
  $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
});
```

```css
/&#42; prefixed with `animate-` &#42;/
.animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
  transition: all 1s linear;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

The `classNameFilter` approach generally gives a big speed boost compared to other strategies,
because the matching is done before other animation disabling strategies are checked. However, that
also means it is not possible to override class name matching with the two following strategies.
It's of course still possible to enable / disable animations by changing an element's class name at
runtime.

### At runtime: {@link ng.$animate#enabled $animate.enabled()}

This function can be used to enable / disable animations in two different ways:

With a single `boolean` argument, it enables / disables animations globally:
`$animate.enabled(false)` disables all animations in your app.

When the first argument is a native DOM or jqLite/jQuery element, the function enables / disables
animations on this element *and all its children*: `$animate.enabled(myElement, false)`. You can
still use it to re-enable animations for a child element, even if you have disabled them on a parent
element. And compared to the `classNameFilter`, you can change the animation status at runtime
instead of during the config phase.

Note however that the `$animate.enabled()` state for individual elements does not overwrite
disabling rules that have been set in the {@link $animateProvider#classNameFilter classNameFilter}.

### Via CSS styles: overwriting styles in the `ng-animate` CSS class

Whenever an animation is started, `ngAnimate` applies the `ng-animate` class to the element for the
whole duration of the animation. By applying CSS transition / animation styling to that class, you
can skip an animation:

```css
.my-class {
  transition: transform 2s;
}

.my-class:hover {
  transform: translateX(50px);
}

my-class.ng-animate {
  transition: 0s;
}
```

By setting `transition: 0s`, `ngAnimate` will ignore the existing transition styles, and not try to
animate them (Javascript animations will still execute, though). This can be used to prevent
{@link guide/animations#preventing-collisions-with-existing-animations-and-third-party-libraries
issues with existing animations interfering with `ngAnimate`}.


## Preventing flicker before an animation starts

When nesting elements with structural animations, such as `ngIf`, into elements that have
class-based animations such as `ngClass`, it sometimes happens that before the actual animation
starts, there is a brief flicker or flash of content where the animated element is briefly visible.

To prevent this, you can apply styles to the `ng-[event]-prepare` class, which is added as soon as
an animation is initialized, but removed before the actual animation starts (after waiting for a
`$digest`). This class is only added for *structural* animations (`enter`, `move`, and `leave`).

Here's an example where you might see flickering:

```html
<div ng-class="{red: myProp}">
  <div ng-class="{blue: myProp}">
    <div class="message" ng-if="myProp"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

It is possible that during the `enter` event, the `.message` div will be briefly visible before it
starts animating. In that case, you can add styles to the CSS that make sure the element stays
hidden before the animation starts:

```css
.message.ng-enter-prepare {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* Other animation styles ... */
```

## Preventing collisions with existing animations and third-party libraries

By default, any `ngAnimate`-enabled directives will assume that `transition` / `animation` styles on
the element are part of an `ngAnimate` animation. This can lead to problems when the styles are
actually for animations that are independent of `ngAnimate`.

For example, an element acts as a loading spinner. It has an infinite css animation on it, and also
an {@link ngIf `ngIf`} directive, for which no animations are defined:

```css
.spinner {
  animation: rotating 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes rotating {
  from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

Now, when the `ngIf` expression changes, `ngAnimate` will see the spinner animation and use it to
animate the `enter`/`leave` event, which doesn't work because the animation is infinite. The element
will still be added / removed after a timeout, but there will be a noticeable delay.

This might also happen because some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across
many element or className selectors in order to make their code small and reusable.

You can prevent this unwanted behavior by adding CSS to the `.ng-animate` class, that is added for
the whole duration of each animation. Simply overwrite the transition / animation duration. In the
case of the spinner, this would be:

```css
.spinner.ng-animate {
  animation: 0s none;
  transition: 0s none;
}
```

If you do have CSS transitions / animations defined for the animation events, make sure they have a
higher priority than any styles that are not related to `ngAnimate`.

You can also use one of the other
{@link guide/animations#how-to-selectively-enable-disable-and-skip-animations
strategies to disable animations}.


## Enable animations outside of the application DOM tree: {@link ng.$animate#pin $animate.pin()}

Before animating, `ngAnimate` checks if the animated element is inside the application DOM tree. If
not, no animation is run. Usually, this is not a problem since most apps use the `html` or `body`
elements as their root.

Problems arise when the application is bootstrapped on a different element, and animations are
attempted on elements that are outside the application tree, e.g. when libraries append popup or
modal elements to the body tag.

You can use {@link ng.$animate#pin `$animate.pin(element, parentHost)`} to associate an element with
another element that belongs to your application. Simply call it before the element is added to the
DOM / before the animation starts, with the element you want to animate, and the element which
should be its assumed parent.

{@link ng.$animate API documentation}.

@description

# Bootstrap

This page explains the AngularJS initialization process and how you can manually initialize AngularJS
if necessary.


## AngularJS `<script>` Tag

This example shows the recommended path for integrating AngularJS with what we call automatic
initialization.


```html
<!doctype html>
<html xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org" ng-app>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="angular.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

  1. Place the `script` tag at the bottom of the page. Placing script tags at the end of the page
    improves app load time because the HTML loading is not blocked by loading of the `angular.js`
    script. You can get the latest bits from http://code.angularjs.org. Please don't link
    your production code to this URL, as it will expose a security hole on your site. For
    experimental development linking to our site is fine.
    * Choose: `angular-[version].js` for a human-readable file, suitable for development and
      debugging.
    * Choose: `angular-[version].min.js` for a compressed and obfuscated file, suitable for use in
      production.
  2. Place `ng-app` to the root of your application, typically on the `<html>` tag if you want
    AngularJS to auto-bootstrap your application.

        <html ng-app>

  3. If you choose to use the old style directive syntax `ng:` then include xml-namespace in `html`
    when running the page in the XHTML mode. (This is here for historical reasons, and we no longer
    recommend use of `ng:`.)

        <html xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org">



## Automatic Initialization

<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em;" src="img/guide/concepts-startup.png">

AngularJS initializes automatically upon `DOMContentLoaded` event or when the `angular.js` script is
evaluated if at that time `document.readyState` is set to `'complete'`. At this point AngularJS looks
for the {@link ng.directive:ngApp `ngApp`} directive which designates your application root.
If the {@link ng.directive:ngApp `ngApp`} directive is found then AngularJS will:

  * load the {@link guide/module module} associated with the directive.
  * create the application {@link auto.$injector injector}
  * compile the DOM treating the {@link ng.directive:ngApp
    `ngApp`} directive as the root of the compilation. This allows you to tell it to treat only a
    portion of the DOM as an AngularJS application.


```html
<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="optionalModuleName">
  <body>
    I can add: {{ 1+2 }}.
    <script src="angular.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

As a best practice, consider adding an `ng-strict-di` directive on the same element as
`ng-app`:


```html
<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="optionalModuleName" ng-strict-di>
  <body>
    I can add: {{ 1+2 }}.
    <script src="angular.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This will ensure that all services in your application are properly annotated.
See the {@link guide/di#using-strict-dependency-injection dependency injection strict mode} docs
for more.


## Manual Initialization

If you need to have more control over the initialization process, you can use a manual
bootstrapping method instead. Examples of when you'd need to do this include using script loaders
or the need to perform an operation before AngularJS compiles a page.

Here is an example of manually initializing AngularJS:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
  <div ng-controller="MyController">
    Hello {{greetMe}}!
  </div>
  <script src="http://code.angularjs.org/snapshot/angular.js"></script>

  <script>
    angular.module('myApp', [])
      .controller('MyController', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
        $scope.greetMe = 'World';
      }]);

    angular.element(function() {
      angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp']);
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Note that we provided the name of our application module to be loaded into the injector as the second
parameter of the {@link angular.bootstrap} function. Notice that `angular.bootstrap` will not create modules
on the fly. You must create any custom {@link guide/module modules} before you pass them as a parameter.

You should call `angular.bootstrap()` *after* you've loaded or defined your modules.
You cannot add controllers, services, directives, etc after an application bootstraps.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** You should not use the ng-app directive when manually bootstrapping your app.
</div>

This is the sequence that your code should follow:

  1. After the page and all of the code is loaded, find the root element of your AngularJS
  application, which is typically the root of the document.

  2. Call {@link angular.bootstrap} to {@link compiler compile} the element into an
  executable, bi-directionally bound application.

## Things to keep in mind

There are a few things to keep in mind regardless of automatic or manual bootstrapping:

- While it's possible to bootstrap more than one AngularJS application per page, we don't actively
  test against this scenario. It's possible that you'll run into problems, especially with complex apps, so
  caution is advised.
- Do not bootstrap your app on an element with a directive that uses {@link ng.$compile#transclusion transclusion}, such as
  {@link ng.ngIf `ngIf`}, {@link ng.ngInclude `ngInclude`} and {@link ngRoute.ngView `ngView`}.
  Doing this misplaces the app {@link ng.$rootElement `$rootElement`} and the app's {@link auto.$injector injector},
  causing animations to stop working and making the injector inaccessible from outside the app.

## Deferred Bootstrap

This feature enables tools like [Batarang](https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang) and test runners
to hook into angular's bootstrap process and sneak in more modules
into the DI registry which can replace or augment DI services for
the purpose of instrumentation or mocking out heavy dependencies.

If `window.name` contains prefix `NG_DEFER_BOOTSTRAP!` when
{@link angular.bootstrap} is called, the bootstrap process will be paused
until `angular.resumeBootstrap()` is called.

`angular.resumeBootstrap()` takes an optional array of modules that
should be added to the original list of modules that the app was
about to be bootstrapped with.

@description

# HTML Compiler

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** this guide is targeted towards developers who are already familiar with AngularJS basics.

If you're just getting started, we recommend the {@link tutorial/ tutorial} first.
If you just want to create custom directives, we recommend the {@link guide/directive directives guide}.
If you want a deeper look into AngularJS's compilation process, you're in the right place.
</div>


## Overview

AngularJS's {@link ng.$compile HTML compiler} allows the developer to teach the
browser new HTML syntax. The compiler allows you to attach behavior to any HTML element or attribute
and even create new HTML elements or attributes with custom behavior. AngularJS calls these behavior
extensions {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.

HTML has a lot of constructs for formatting the HTML for static documents in a declarative fashion.
For example if something needs to be centered, there is no need to provide instructions to the
browser how the window size needs to be divided in half so that the center is found, and that this
center needs to be aligned with the text's center. Simply add an `align="center"` attribute to any
element to achieve the desired behavior. Such is the power of declarative language.

However, the declarative language is also limited, as it does not allow you to teach the browser new
syntax. For example, there is no easy way to get the browser to align the text at 1/3 the position
instead of 1/2. What is needed is a way to teach the browser new HTML syntax.

AngularJS comes pre-bundled with common directives which are useful for building any app. We also
expect that you will create directives that are specific to your app. These extensions become a
Domain Specific Language for building your application.

All of this compilation takes place in the web browser; no server side or pre-compilation step is
involved.


## Compiler

Compiler is an AngularJS service which traverses the DOM looking for attributes. The compilation
process happens in two phases.

  1. **Compile:** traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives. The result is a linking
  function.

  2. **Link:** combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the
  scope model are reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected
  in the scope model. This makes the scope model the single source of truth.

Some directives such as {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ng-repeat`} clone DOM elements once
for each item in a collection. Having a compile and link phase improves performance since the
cloned template only needs to be compiled once, and then linked once for each clone instance.


## Directive

A directive is a behavior which should be triggered when specific HTML constructs are encountered
during the compilation process. The directives can be placed in element names, attributes, class
names, as well as comments. Here are some equivalent examples of invoking the {@link
ng.directive:ngBind `ng-bind`} directive.

```html
  <span ng-bind="exp"></span>
  <span class="ng-bind: exp;"></span>
  <ng-bind></ng-bind>
  <!-- directive: ng-bind exp -->
```

A directive is just a function which executes when the compiler encounters it in the DOM. See {@link
ng.$compileProvider#directive directive API} for in-depth documentation on how
to write directives.

Here is a directive which makes any element draggable. Notice the `draggable` attribute on the
`<span>` element.

<example module="drag" name="draggable">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('drag', []).
      directive('draggable', function($document) {
        return function(scope, element, attr) {
          var startX = 0, startY = 0, x = 0, y = 0;
          element.css({
           position: 'relative',
           border: '1px solid red',
           backgroundColor: 'lightgrey',
           cursor: 'pointer',
           display: 'block',
           width: '65px'
          });
          element.on('mousedown', function(event) {
            // Prevent default dragging of selected content
            event.preventDefault();
            startX = event.screenX - x;
            startY = event.screenY - y;
            $document.on('mousemove', mousemove);
            $document.on('mouseup', mouseup);
          });

          function mousemove(event) {
            y = event.screenY - startY;
            x = event.screenX - startX;
            element.css({
              top: y + 'px',
              left:  x + 'px'
            });
          }

          function mouseup() {
            $document.off('mousemove', mousemove);
            $document.off('mouseup', mouseup);
          }
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <span draggable>Drag ME</span>
  </file>
</example>


The presence of the `draggable` attribute on any element gives the element new behavior.
We extended the vocabulary of the browser in a way which is natural to anyone who is familiar with the principles of HTML.


## Understanding View

Most other templating systems consume a static string template and
combine it with data, resulting in a new string. The resulting text is then `innerHTML`ed into
an element.

<img src="img/One_Way_Data_Binding.png">

This means that any changes to the data need to be re-merged with the template and then
`innerHTML`ed into the DOM. Some of the issues with this approach are:

1. reading user input and merging it with data
2. clobbering user input by overwriting it
3. managing the whole update process
4. lack of behavior expressiveness

AngularJS is different. The AngularJS compiler consumes the DOM, not string templates.
The result is a linking function, which when combined with a scope model results in a live view. The
view and scope model bindings are transparent. The developer does not need to make any special calls to update
the view. And because `innerHTML` is not used, you won't accidentally clobber user input.
Furthermore, AngularJS directives can contain not just text bindings, but behavioral constructs as
well.

<img src="img/Two_Way_Data_Binding.png">

The AngularJS approach produces a stable DOM. The DOM element instance bound to a model
item instance does not change for the lifetime of the binding. This means that the code can get
hold of the elements and register event handlers and know that the reference will not be destroyed
by template data merge.



## How directives are compiled

It's important to note that AngularJS operates on DOM nodes rather than strings. Usually, you don't
notice this restriction because when a page loads, the web browser parses HTML into the DOM automatically.

HTML compilation happens in three phases:

  1. {@link ng.$compile `$compile`} traverses the DOM and matches directives.

  If the compiler finds that an element matches a directive, then the directive is added to the list of
  directives that match the DOM element. A single element may match multiple directives.

  2. Once all directives matching a DOM element have been identified, the compiler sorts the directives
  by their `priority`.

  Each directive's `compile` functions are executed. Each `compile` function has a chance to
  modify the DOM. Each `compile` function returns a `link` function. These functions are composed into
  a "combined" link function, which invokes each directive's returned `link` function.

  3. `$compile` links the template with the scope by calling the combined linking function from the previous step.
  This in turn will call the linking function of the individual directives, registering listeners on the elements
  and setting up {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`s} with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope `scope`}
  as each directive is configured to do.

The result of this is a live binding between the scope and the DOM. So at this point, a change in
a model on the compiled scope will be reflected in the DOM.

Below is the corresponding code using the `$compile` service.
This should help give you an idea of what AngularJS does internally.

```js
  var $compile = ...; // injected into your code
  var scope = ...;
  var parent = ...; // DOM element where the compiled template can be appended

  var html = '<div ng-bind="exp"></div>';

  // Step 1: parse HTML into DOM element
  var template = angular.element(html);

  // Step 2: compile the template
  var linkFn = $compile(template);

  // Step 3: link the compiled template with the scope.
  var element = linkFn(scope);

  // Step 4: Append to DOM (optional)
  parent.appendChild(element);
```

### The difference between Compile and Link

At this point you may wonder why the compile process has separate compile and link phases. The
short answer is that compile and link separation is needed any time a change in a model causes
a change in the **structure** of the DOM.

It's rare for directives to have a **compile function**, since most directives are concerned with
working with a specific DOM element instance rather than changing its overall structure.

Directives often have a **link function**. A link function allows the directive to register
listeners to the specific cloned DOM element instance as well as to copy content into the DOM
from the scope.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Any operation which can be shared among the instance of directives should be
moved to the compile function for performance reasons.
</div>

#### An Example of "Compile" Versus "Link"

To understand, let's look at a real-world example with `ngRepeat`:

```html
Hello {{user.name}}, you have these actions:
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="action in user.actions">
    {{action.description}}
  </li>
</ul>
```

When the above example is compiled, the compiler visits every node and looks for directives.

`{{user.name}}` matches the {@link ng.$interpolate interpolation directive}
and `ng-repeat` matches the {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat` directive}.

But {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} has a dilemma.

It needs to be able to clone new `<li>` elements for every `action` in `user.actions`.
This initially seems trivial, but it becomes more complicated when you consider that `user.actions`
might have items added to it later. This means that it needs to save a clean copy of the `<li>`
element for cloning purposes.

As new `action`s are inserted, the template `<li>` element needs to be cloned and inserted into `ul`.
But cloning the `<li>` element is not enough. It also needs to compile the `<li>` so that its
directives, like `{{action.description}}`, evaluate against the right {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope}.


A naive approach to solving this problem would be to simply insert a copy of the `<li>` element and
then compile it.
The problem with this approach is that compiling on every `<li>` element that we clone would duplicate
a lot of the work. Specifically, we'd be traversing `<li>` each time before cloning it to find the
directives. This would cause the compilation process to be slower, in turn making applications
less responsive when inserting new nodes.

The solution is to break the compilation process into two phases:

the **compile phase** where all of the directives are identified and sorted by priority,
and a **linking phase** where any work which "links" a specific instance of the
{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} and the specific instance of an `<li>` is performed.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** *Link* means setting up listeners on the DOM and setting up `$watch` on the Scope to
keep the two in sync.
</div>

{@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} works by preventing the compilation process from
descending into the `<li>` element so it can make a clone of the original and handle inserting
and removing DOM nodes itself.

Instead the {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} directive compiles `<li>` separately.
The result of the `<li>` element compilation is a linking function which contains all of the
directives contained in the `<li>` element, ready to be attached to a specific clone of the `<li>`
element.

At runtime the {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`} watches the expression and as items
are added to the array it clones the `<li>` element, creates a new
{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} for the cloned `<li>` element and calls the link function
on the cloned `<li>`.



### Understanding How Scopes Work with Transcluded Directives

One of the most common use cases for directives is to create reusable components.

Below is a pseudo code showing how a simplified dialog component may work.

```html
<div>
  <button ng-click="show=true">show</button>

  <dialog title="Hello {{username}}."
          visible="show"
          on-cancel="show = false"
          on-ok="show = false; doSomething()">
     Body goes here: {{username}} is {{title}}.
  </dialog>
</div>
```

Clicking on the "show" button will open the dialog. The dialog will have a title, which is
data bound to `username`, and it will also have a body which we would like to transclude
into the dialog.

Here is an example of what the template definition for the `dialog` widget may look like.

```html
<div ng-show="visible">
  <h3>{{title}}</h3>
  <div class="body" ng-transclude></div>
  <div class="footer">
    <button ng-click="onOk()">Save changes</button>
    <button ng-click="onCancel()">Close</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

This will not render properly, unless we do some scope magic.

The first issue we have to solve is that the dialog box template expects `title` to be defined.
But we would like the template's scope property `title` to be the result of interpolating the
`<dialog>` element's `title` attribute (i.e. `"Hello {{username}}"`). Furthermore, the buttons expect
the `onOk` and `onCancel` functions to be present in the scope. This limits the usefulness of the
widget. To solve the mapping issue we use the `scope` to create local variables which the template
expects as follows:

```js
  scope: {
    title: '@',             // the title uses the data-binding from the parent scope
    onOk: '&',              // create a delegate onOk function
    onCancel: '&',          // create a delegate onCancel function
    visible: '='            // set up visible to accept data-binding
  }
```

Creating local properties on widget scope creates two problems:

  1. isolation - if the user forgets to set `title` attribute of the dialog widget the dialog
     template will bind to parent scope property. This is unpredictable and undesirable.

  2. transclusion - the transcluded DOM can see the widget locals, which may overwrite the
     properties which the transclusion needs for data-binding. In our example the `title`
     property of the widget clobbers the `title` property of the transclusion.


To solve the issue of lack of isolation, the directive declares a new `isolated` scope. An
isolated scope does not prototypically inherit from the parent scope, and therefore we don't have
to worry about accidentally clobbering any properties.

However `isolated` scope creates a new problem: if a transcluded DOM is a child of the widget
isolated scope then it will not be able to bind to anything. For this reason the transcluded scope
is a child of the original scope, before the widget created an isolated scope for its local
variables. This makes the transcluded and widget isolated scope siblings.

This may seem to be unexpected complexity, but it gives the widget user and developer the least
surprise.

Therefore the final directive definition looks something like this:

```js
transclude: true,
scope: {
    title: '@',             // the title uses the data-binding from the parent scope
    onOk: '&',              // create a delegate onOk function
    onCancel: '&',          // create a delegate onCancel function
    visible: '='            // set up visible to accept data-binding
},
restrict: 'E',
replace: true
```

### Double Compilation, and how to avoid it

Double compilation occurs when an already compiled part of the DOM gets compiled again. This is an
undesired effect and can lead to misbehaving directives, performance issues, and memory
leaks.
A common scenario where this happens is a directive that calls `$compile` in a directive link
function on the directive element. In the following **faulty example**, a directive adds a mouseover behavior
to a button with `ngClick` on it:

```
angular.module('app').directive('addMouseover', function($compile) {
  return {
    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
      var newEl = angular.element('<span ng-show="showHint"> My Hint</span>');
      element.on('mouseenter mouseleave', function() {
        scope.$apply('showHint = !showHint');
      });

      attrs.$set('addMouseover', null); // To stop infinite compile loop
      element.append(newEl);
      $compile(element)(scope); // Double compilation
    }
  }
})
```

At first glance, it looks like removing the original `addMouseover` attribute is all there is needed
to make this example work.
However, if the directive element or its children have other directives attached, they will be compiled and
linked again, because the compiler doesn't keep track of which directives have been assigned to which
elements.

This can cause unpredictable behavior, e.g. `ngClick` or other event handlers will be attached
again. It can also degrade performance, as watchers for text interpolation are added twice to the scope.

Double compilation should therefore be avoided. In the above example, only the new element should
be compiled:

```
angular.module('app').directive('addMouseover', function($compile) {
  return {
    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
      var newEl = angular.element('<span ng-show="showHint"> My Hint</span>');
      element.on('mouseenter mouseleave', function() {
        scope.$apply('showHint = !showHint');
      });

      element.append(newEl);
      $compile(newEl)(scope); // Only compile the new element
    }
  }
})
```

Another scenario is adding a directive programmatically to a compiled element and then executing
compile again. See the following **faulty example**:

```html
<input ng-model="$ctrl.value" add-options>
```

```
angular.module('app').directive('addOptions', function($compile) {
  return {
    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
      attrs.$set('addOptions', null) // To stop infinite compile loop
      attrs.$set('ngModelOptions', '{debounce: 1000}');
      $compile(element)(scope); // Double compilation
    }
  }
});
```

In that case, it is necessary to intercept the *initial* compilation of the element:

  1. Give your directive the `terminal` property and a higher priority than directives
  that should not be compiled twice. In the example, the compiler will only compile directives
  which have a priority of 100 or higher.
  2. Inside this directive's compile function, add any other directive attributes to the template.
  3. Compile the element, but restrict the maximum priority, so that any already compiled directives
  (including the `addOptions` directive) are not compiled again.
  4. In the link function, link the compiled element with the element's scope.

```
angular.module('app').directive('addOptions', function($compile) {
  return {
    priority: 100, // ngModel has priority 1
    terminal: true,
    compile: function(templateElement, templateAttributes) {
      templateAttributes.$set('ngModelOptions', '{debounce: 1000}');

      // The third argument is the max priority. Only directives with priority < 100 will be compiled,
      // therefore we don't need to remove the attribute
      var compiled = $compile(templateElement, null, 100);

      return function linkFn(scope) {
        compiled(scope) // Link compiled element to scope
      }
    }
  }
});
```

# Component Router

<div class="alert alert-danger">
**Deprecation Notice:** In an effort to keep synchronized with router changes in the new Angular, this implementation of the Component Router (ngComponentRouter module) has been deprecated and will not receive further updates.
We are investigating backporting the new Angular Router to AngularJS, but alternatively, use the {@link ngRoute} module or community developed projects (e.g. [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)).
</div>

This guide describes the Component Router for AngularJS.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  If you are looking for information about the default router for AngularJS have a look at the {@link ngRoute} module.

  If you are looking for information about the Component Router for the new Angular then
  check out the [Angular Router Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html).
</div>

## Overview

Here is a table of the main concepts used in the Component Router.

| Concept               | Description |
| ----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router                | Displays the Routing Components for the active Route. Manages navigation from one component to the next. |
| RootRouter            | The top level Router that interacts with the current URL location |
| RouteConfig           | Configures a Router with RouteDefinitions, each mapping a URL path to a component. |
| Routing Component     | An AngularJS component with a RouteConfig and an associated Router. |
| RouteDefinition       | Defines how the router should navigate to a component based on a URL pattern. |
| ngOutlet              | The directive (`<ng-outlet>`) that marks where the router should display a view. |
| ngLink                | The directive (`ng-link="..."`) for binding a clickable HTML element to a route, via a Link Parameters Array. |
| Link Parameters Array | An array that the router interprets into a routing instruction. We can bind a RouterLink to that array or pass the array as an argument to the Router.navigate method. |


## Component-based Applications

It is recommended to develop AngularJS applications as a hierarchy of Components. Each Component
is an isolated part of the application, which is responsible for its own user interface and has
a well defined programmatic interface to the Component that contains it. Take a look at the
{@link guide/component component guide} for more information.

![Component Based Architecture](img/guide/component-based-architecture.svg)


## URLs and Navigation

In most applications, users navigate from one view to the next as they perform application tasks.
The browser provides a familiar model of application navigation. We enter a URL in the address bar
or click on a link and the browser navigates to a new page. We click the browser's back and forward
buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages we've seen.

We understand that each view corresponds to a particular URL. In a Component-based application,
each of these views is implemented by one or more Components.


## Component Routes

**How do we choose which Components to display given a particular URL?**

When using the Component Router, each **Component** in the application can have a **Router** associated
with it. This **Router** contains a mapping of URL segments to child **Components**.

```js
$routeConfig: [
  { path: '/a/b/c', component: 'someComponent' }, ...
]
```

This means that for a given URL the **Router** will render an associated child **Component**.


## Outlets

**How do we know where to render a child Component?**

Each **Routing Component**, needs to have a template that contains one or more **Outlets**, which is
where its child **Components** are rendered. We specify the **Outlet** in the template using the
{@link ngOutlet `<ng-outlet>`} directive.

```html
<ng-outlet></ng-outlet>
```

*In the future `ng-outlet` will be able to render different child **Components** for a given **Route**
by specifying a `name` attribute.*


## Root Router and Component

**How does the Component Router know which Component to render first?**

All Component Router applications must contain a top level **Routing Component**, which is associated with
a top level **Root Router**.

The **Root Router** is the starting point for all navigation. You can access this **Router** by injecting the
`$rootRouter` service.

We define the top level **Root Component** by providing a value for the {@link $routerRootComponent} service.

```js
myModule.value('$routerRootComponent', 'myApp');
```

Here we have specified that the **Root Component** is the component directive with the name `myApp`.

Remember to instantiate this **Root Component** in our `index.html` file.

```html
<my-app></my-app>
```

## Route Matching

When we navigate to any given URL, the {@link $rootRouter} matches its **Route Config** against the URL.
If a **Route Definition** in the **Route Config** recognizes a part of the URL then the **Component**
associated with the **Route Definition** is instantiated and rendered in the **Outlet**.

If the new **Component** contains routes of its own then a new **Router ({@link ChildRouter})** is created for
this **Routing Component**.

The {@link ChildRouter} for the new **Routing Component** then attempts to match its **Route Config** against
the parts of the URL that have not already been matched by the previous **Router**.

This process continues until we run out of **Routing Components** or consume the entire URL.

![Routed Components](img/guide/component-routes.svg)

In the previous diagram, we can see that the URL `/heros/4` has been matched against the `App`, `Heroes` and
`HeroDetail` **Routing Components**. The **Routers** for each of the **Routing Components** consumed a part
of the URL: "/", "/heroes" and "/4" respectively.

The result is that we end up with a hierarchy of **Routing Components** rendered in **Outlets**, via the
{@link ngOutlet} directive, in each **Routing Component's** template, as you can see in the following diagram.

</example>


### Getting Started

In the following sections we will step through building this application. The finished application has views
to display list and detail views of Heroes and Crises.

#### Install the libraries

It is easier to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the
**Component Router** module. For this guide we will also install AngularJS itself via Yarn:

```bash
yarn init
yarn add angular@1.5.x @angular/router@0.2.0
```


#### Load the scripts

Just like any AngularJS application, we load the JavaScript files into our `index.html`:

```html
  <script src="/node_modules/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="/node_modules/@angular/router/angular1/angular_1_router.js"></script>
  <script src="/app/app.js"></script>
```

You also need to include ES6 shims for browsers that do not support ES6 code (Internet Explorer,
 iOs < 8, Android < 5.0, Windows Mobile < 10):
 ```html
 <!-- IE required polyfills, in this exact order -->
 <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/es6-shim/0.33.3/es6-shim.min.js"></script>
 <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/systemjs/0.19.20/system-polyfills.js"></script>
 <script src="https://unpkg.com/angular2/es6/dev/src/testing/shims_for_IE.js"></script>
 ```

#### Create the `app` module

In the app.js file, create the main application module `app` which depends on the `ngComponentRouter`
module, which is provided by the **Component Router** script.

```js
angular.module('app', ['ngComponentRouter'])
```

We must choose what **Location Mode** the **Router** should use. We are going to use HTML5 mode locations,
so that we will not have hash-based paths. We must rely on the browser to provide `pushState` support,
which is true for most modern browsers. See {@link $locationProvider#html5Mode} for more information.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Using HTML5 mode means that we can have clean URLs for our application routes. However, HTML5 mode does require that our
  web server, which hosts the application, understands that it must respond with the index.html file for
  requests to URLs that represent all our application routes. We are going to use the `lite-server` web server
  to do this for us.
</div>

```js
.config(function($locationProvider) {
  $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
})
```

Configure the top level routed `App` Component.

```js
.value('$routerRootComponent', 'app')
```

Create a very simple App Component to test that the application is working.

We are using the AngularJS {@link $compileProvider#component `.component()`} helper method to create
all the **Components** in our application. It is perfectly suited to this task.

```js
.component('app', {
  template: 'It worked!'
});
```

Add a `<base>` element to the head of our index.html.
Remember that we have chosen to use HTML5 mode for the `$location` service. This means that our HTML
must have a base URL.

```html
<head>
  <base href="/">
  ...
```

#### Bootstrap AngularJS

Bootstrap the AngularJS application and add the top level App Component.

```html
<body ng-app="app">
    <h1 class="title">Component Router</h1>
    <app></app>
  </body>
```


### Implementing the AppComponent

In the previous section we have created a single top level **App Component**. Let's now create some more
**Routing Components** and wire up **Route Config** for those. We start with a Heroes Feature, which
will display one of two views.

* A list of Heroes that are available:

![Heroes List View](img/guide/heroes-list.png)

* A detailed view of a single Hero:

![Heroes List View](img/guide/hero-detail.png)

We are going to have a `Heroes` Component for the Heroes feature of our application, and then `HeroList`
and `HeroDetail` **Components** that will actually display the two different views.


#### App Component

Configure the **App Component** with a template and **Route Config**:

```js
.component('app', {
  template:
    '<nav>\n' +
    '  <a>Crisis Center</a>\n' +
    '  <a ng-link="[\'Heroes\']">Heroes</a>\n' +
    '</nav>\n' +
    '<ng-outlet></ng-outlet>\n',
  $routeConfig: [
    {path: '/heroes/...', name: 'Heroes', component: 'heroes'},
  ]
});
```

The **App Component** has an `<ng-outlet>` directive in its template. This is where the child **Components**
of this view will be rendered.

#### ngLink

We have used the `ng-link` directive to create a link to navigate to the Heroes Component. By using this
directive we don't need to know what the actual URL will be. We can let the Router generate that for us.

We have included a link to the Crisis Center but have not included the `ng-link` directive as we have not yet
implemented the CrisisCenter component.


#### Non-terminal Routes

We need to tell the **Router** that the `Heroes` **Route Definition** is **non-terminal**, that it should
continue to match **Routes** in its child **Components**. We do this by adding a **continuation ellipsis
(`...`)** to the path of the Heroes Route, `/heroes/...`.
Without the **continuation ellipsis** the `HeroList` **Route** will never be matched because the Router will
stop at the `Heroes` **Routing Component** and not try to match the rest of the URL.


### Heroes Feature

Now we can implement our Heroes Feature which consists of three **Components**: `Heroes`, `HeroList` and
`HeroDetail`. The `Heroes` **Routing Component** simply provides a template containing the {@link ngOutlet}
directive and a **Route Config** that defines a set of child **Routes** which delegate through to the
`HeroList` and `HeroDetail` **Components**.

### HeroesComponent

Create a new file `heroes.js`, which defines a new AngularJS module for the **Components** of this feature
and registers the Heroes **Component**.

```js
angular.module('heroes', [])
  .component('heroes', {
    template: '<h2>Heroes</h2><ng-outlet></ng-outlet>',
    $routeConfig: [
      {path: '/',    name: 'HeroList',   component: 'heroList', useAsDefault: true},
      {path: '/:id', name: 'HeroDetail', component: 'heroDetail'}
    ]
  })
```

Remember to load this file in the index.html:

```html
<script src="/app/heroes.js"></script>
```

and also to add the module as a dependency of the `app` module:

```js
angular.module('app', ['ngComponentRouter', 'heroes'])
```

#### Use As Default
The `useAsDefault` property on the `HeroList` **Route Definition**, indicates that if no other **Route
Definition** matches the URL, then this **Route Definition** should be used by default.

#### Route Parameters
The `HeroDetail` Route has a named parameter (`id`), indicated by prefixing the URL segment with a colon,
as part of its `path` property. The **Router** will match anything in this segment and make that value
available to the HeroDetail **Component**.

#### Terminal Routes
Both the Routes in the `HeroesComponent` are terminal, i.e. their routes do not end with `...`. This is
because the `HeroList` and `HeroDetail` will not contain any child routes.

#### Route Names
**What is the difference between the `name` and `component` properties on a Route Definition?**

The `component` property in a **Route Definition** defines the **Component** directive that will be rendered
into the DOM via the **Outlet**. For example the `heroDetail` **Component** will be rendered into the page
where the `<ng-outlet></ng-outlet>` lives as `<hero-detail></hero-detail>`.

The `name` property is used to reference the **Route Definition** when generating URLs or navigating to
**Routes**. For example this link will `<a ng-link="['Heroes']">Heroes</a>` navigate the **Route Definition**
that has the `name` property of `"Heroes"`.


### HeroList Component

The HeroList **Component** is the first component in the application that actually contains significant
functionality. It loads up a list of heroes from a `heroService` and displays them using `ng-repeat`.
Add it to the `heroes.js` file:

```js
  .component('heroList', {
    template:
      '<div ng-repeat="hero in $ctrl.heroes">\n' +
        '<a ng-link="[\'HeroDetail\', {id: hero.id}]">{{hero.name}}</a>\n' +
      '</div>',
    controller: HeroListComponent
  })
```

The `ng-link` directive creates links to a more detailed view of each hero, via the expression
`['HeroDetail', {id: hero.id}]`. This expression is an array describing what Routes to use to generate
the link. The first item is the name of the HeroDetail **Route Definition** and the second is a parameter
object that will be available to the HeroDetail **Component**.

*The HeroDetail section below explains how to get hold of the `id` parameter of the HeroDetail Route.*

The template iterates through each `hero` object of the array in the `$ctrl.heroes` property.

*Remember that the `module.component()` helper automatically provides the **Component's Controller** as
the `$ctrl` property on the scope of the template.*


### HeroService

Our HeroService simulates requesting a list of heroes from a server. In a real application this would be
making an actual server request, perhaps over HTTP.

```js
function HeroService($q) {
  var heroesPromise = $q.resolve([
    { id: 11, name: 'Mr. Nice' },
    ...
  ]);

  this.getHeroes = function() {
    return heroesPromise;
  };

  this.getHero = function(id) {
    return heroesPromise.then(function(heroes) {
      for (var i = 0; i < heroes.length; i++) {
        if (heroes[i].id === id) return heroes[i];
      }
    });
  };
}
```

Note that both the `getHeroes()` and `getHero(id)` methods return a promise for the data. This is because
in real-life we would have to wait for the server to respond with the data.


### Router Lifecycle Hooks

**How do I know when my Component is active?**

To deal with initialization and tidy up of **Components** that are rendered by a **Router**, we can implement
one or more **Lifecycle Hooks** on the **Component**. These will be called at well defined points in the
lifecycle of the **Component**.

The **Lifecycle Hooks** that can be implemented as instance methods on the **Component** are as follows:

* `$routerCanReuse` : called to to determine whether a **Component** can be reused across **Route Definitions**
  that match the same type of **Component**, or whether to destroy and instantiate a new **Component** every time.
* `$routerOnActivate` / `$routerOnReuse` : called by the **Router** at the end of a successful navigation. Only
  one of `$routerOnActivate` and `$routerOnReuse` will be called depending upon the result of a call to
  `$routerCanReuse`.
* `$routerCanDeactivate` : called by the **Router** to determine if a **Component** can be removed as part of a
  navigation.
* `$routerOnDeactivate` : called by the **Router** before destroying a **Component** as part of a navigation.

We can also provide an **Injectable function** (`$routerCanActivate`) on the **Component Definition Object**,
or as a static method on the **Component**, that will determine whether this **Component** is allowed to be
activated. If any of the `$routerCan...` methods return false or a promise that resolves to false, the
navigation will be cancelled.

For our HeroList **Component** we want to load up the list of heroes when the **Component** is activated.
So we implement the `$routerOnActivate()` instance method.

```js
function HeroListComponent(heroService) {
  var $ctrl = this;
  this.$routerOnActivate = function() {
    return heroService.getHeroes().then(function(heroes) {
      $ctrl.heroes = heroes;
    });
  }
}
```

Running the application should update the browser's location to `/heroes` and display the list of heroes
returned from the `heroService`.

By returning a promise for the list of heroes from `$routerOnActivate()` we can delay the activation of the
Route until the heroes have arrived successfully. This is similar to how a `resolve` works in {@link ngRoute}.


### Route Parameters

**How do I access parameters for the current route?**

The HeroDetailComponent displays details of an individual hero. The `id` of the hero to display is passed
as part of the URL, for example **/heroes/12**.

The **Router** parses the id from the URL when it recognizes the **Route Definition** and provides it to the
**Component** as part of the parameters of the `$routerOnActivate()` hook.

```js
function HeroDetailComponent(heroService) {
  var $ctrl = this;

  this.$routerOnActivate = function(next, previous) {
    // Get the hero identified by the route parameter
    var id = next.params.id;
    return heroService.getHero(id).then(function(hero) {
      $ctrl.hero = hero;
    });
  };
```

The `$routerOnActivate(next, previous)` hook receives two parameters, which hold the `next` and `previous`
**Instruction** objects for the **Route** that is being activated.

These parameters have a property called `params` which will hold the `id` parameter extracted from the URL
by the **Router**. In this code it is used to identify a specific Hero to retrieve from the `heroService`.
This hero is then attached to the **Component** so that it can be accessed in the template.


### Access to the Current Router

**How do I get hold of the current router for my component?**

Each component has its own Router. Unlike in the new Angular, we cannot use the dependency injector to get hold of a component's Router.
We can only inject the `$rootRouter`. Instead we use the fact that the `ng-outlet` directive binds the current router to a `$router`
attribute on our component.

```html
<ng-outlet><hero-detail $router="$$router"></hero-detail></ng-outlet>
```

We can then specify a `bindings` property on our component definition to bind the current router to our component:

```js
bindings: { $router: '<' }
```

This sets up a one-way binding of the current Router to the `$router` property of our Component. The binding is available once
the component has been activated, and the `$routerOnActivate` hook is called.

As you might know from reading the {@link guide/component component guide}, the binding is actually available by the time the `$onInit`
hook is called, which is before the call to `$routerOnActivate`.

### HeroDetailComponent

The `HeroDetailComponent` displays a form that allows the Hero to be modified.

```js
  .component('heroDetail', {
    template:
      '<div ng-if="$ctrl.hero">\n' +
      '  <h3>"{{$ctrl.hero.name}}"</h3>\n' +
      '  <div>\n' +
      '    <label>Id: </label>{{$ctrl.hero.id}}</div>\n' +
      '  <div>\n' +
      '    <label>Name: </label>\n' +
      '    <input ng-model="$ctrl.hero.name" placeholder="name"/>\n' +
      '  </div>\n' +
      '  <button ng-click="$ctrl.gotoHeroes()">Back</button>\n' +
      '</div>\n',
    bindings: { $router: '<' },
    controller: HeroDetailComponent
  });
```

The template contains a button to navigate back to the HeroList. We could have styled an anchor to look
like a button and used `ng-link="['HeroList']" but here we demonstrate programmatic navigation via the
Router itself, which was made available by the binding in the **Component Definition Object**.

```js
function HeroDetailComponent(heroService) {
  ...
  this.gotoHeroes = function() {
    this.$router.navigate(['HeroList']);
  };
```

Here we are asking the Router to navigate to a route defined by `['HeroList']`.
This is the same kind of array used by the `ng-link` directive.

Other options for generating this navigation are:
* manually create the URL and call `this.$router.navigateByUrl(url)` - this is discouraged because it
  couples the code of your component to the router URLs.
* generate an Instruction for a route and navigate directly with this instruction.
  ```js
  var instruction = this.$router.generate(['HeroList']);
  this.$router.navigateByInstruction(instruction);
  ```
  this form gives you the possibility of caching the instruction, but is more verbose.

#### Absolute vs Relative Navigation

**Why not use `$rootRouter` to do the navigation?**

Instead of binding to the current **Router**, we can inject the `$rootRouter` into our **Component** and
use that: `$rootRouter.navigate(...)`.

The trouble with doing this is that navigation is always relative to the **Router**. So in order to navigate
to the `HeroListComponent` with the `$rootRouter`, we would have to provide a complete path of Routes:
`['App','Heroes','HeroList']`.


### Extra Parameters

We can also pass additional optional parameters to routes, which get encoded into the URL and are again
available to the `$routerOnActivate(next, previous)` hook. If we pass the current `id` from the
HeroDetailComponent back to the HeroListComponent we can use it to highlight the previously selected hero.

```js
  this.gotoHeroes = function() {
    var heroId = this.hero && this.hero.id;
    this.$router.navigate(['HeroList', {id: heroId}]);
  };
```

Then in the HeroList component we can extract this `id` in the `$routerOnActivate()` hook.

```js
function HeroListComponent(heroService) {
  var selectedId = null;
  var $ctrl = this;

  this.$routerOnActivate = function(next) {
    heroService.getHeroes().then(function(heroes) {
      $ctrl.heroes = heroes;
      selectedId = next.params.id;
    });
  };

  this.isSelected = function(hero) {
    return (hero.id === selectedId);
  };
}
```

Finally, we can use this information to highlight the current hero in the template.

```html
<div ng-repeat="hero in $ctrl.heroes"
       ng-class="{ selected: $ctrl.isSelected(hero) }">
  <a ng-link="['HeroDetail', {id: hero.id}]">{{hero.name}}</a>
</div>
```

### Crisis Center

Let's implement the Crisis Center feature, which displays a list if crises that need to be dealt with by a hero.
The detailed crisis view has an additional feature where it blocks you from navigating if you have not saved
changes to the crisis being edited.

* A list of Crises that are happening:

![Crisis List View](img/guide/crisis-list.png)

* A detailed view of a single Crisis:

![Crisis Detail View](img/guide/crisis-detail.png)


### Crisis Feature

This feature is very similar to the Heroes feature. It contains the following **Components**:

* CrisisService: contains method for getting a list of crises and an individual crisis.
* CrisisListComponent: displays the list of crises, similar to HeroListComponent.
* CrisisDetailComponent: displays a specific crisis

CrisisService and CrisisListComponent are basically the same as HeroService and HeroListComponent
respectively.

### Navigation Control Hooks

**How do I prevent navigation from occurring?**

Each **Component** can provide the `$canActivate` and `$routerCanDeactivate` **Lifecycle Hooks**. The
`$routerCanDeactivate` hook is an instance method on the **Component**. The `$canActivate` hook is used as a
static method defined on the **Component Definition Object**.

The **Router** will call these hooks to control navigation from one **Route** to another. Each of these hooks can
return a `boolean` or a Promise that will resolve to a `boolean`.

During a navigation, some **Components** will become inactive and some will become active. Before the navigation
can complete, all the **Components** must agree that they can be deactivated or activated, respectively.

The **Router** will call the `$routerCanDeactivate` and `$canActivate` hooks, if they are provided. If any
of the hooks resolve to `false` then the navigation is cancelled.

#### Dialog Box Service

We can implement a very simple dialog box that will prompt the user whether they are happy to lose changes they
have made. The result of the prompt is a promise that can be used in a `$routerCanDeactivate` hook.

```js
.service('dialogService', DialogService);

function DialogService($q) {
  this.confirm = function(message) {
    return $q.resolve(window.confirm(message || 'Is it OK?'));
  };
}
```

### CrisisDetailComponent

We put the template into its own file by using a `templateUrl` property in the **Component Definition
Object**:

```js
  .component('crisisDetail', {
    templateUrl: 'app/crisisDetail.html',
    bindings: { $router: '<' },
    controller: CrisisDetailComponent
  });
```

In the `$routerOnActivate` hook, we make a local copy of the `crisis.name` property to compare with the
original value so that we can determine whether the name has changed.

```js
  this.$routerOnActivate = function(next) {
    // Get the crisis identified by the route parameter
    var id = next.params.id;
    crisisService.getCrisis(id).then(function(crisis) {
      if (crisis) {
        ctrl.editName = crisis.name;  // Make a copy of the crisis name for editing
        ctrl.crisis = crisis;
      } else { // id not found
        ctrl.gotoCrises();
      }
    });
  };
```

In the `$routerCanDeactivate` we check whether the name has been modified and ask whether the user
wishes to discard the changes.

```js
  this.$routerCanDeactivate = function() {
    // Allow synchronous navigation (`true`) if no crisis or the crisis is unchanged.
    if (!this.crisis || this.crisis.name === this.editName) {
      return true;
    }
    // Otherwise ask the user with the dialog service and return its
    // promise which resolves to true or false when the user decides
    return dialogService.confirm('Discard changes?');
  };
```

You can test this check by navigating to a crisis detail page, modifying the name and then either
pressing the browser's back button to navigate back to the previous page, or by clicking on one of
the links to the Crisis Center or Heroes features.

The Save and Cancel buttons update the `editName` and/or `crisis.name` properties before navigating
to prevent the `$routerCanDeactivate` hook from displaying the dialog box.

# Understanding Components

In AngularJS, a Component is a special kind of {@link guide/directive directive} that uses a simpler
configuration which is suitable for a component-based application structure.

This makes it easier to write an app in a way that's similar to using Web Components or using the new Angular's
style of application architecture.

Advantages of Components:
- simpler configuration than plain directives
- promote sane defaults and best practices
- optimized for component-based architecture
- writing component directives will make it easier to upgrade to Angular

When not to use Components:

- for directives that need to perform actions in compile and pre-link functions, because they aren't available
- when you need advanced directive definition options like priority, terminal, multi-element
- when you want a directive that is triggered by an attribute or CSS class, rather than an element

## Creating and configuring a Component

Components can be registered using the {@link ng.$compileProvider#component `.component()`} method of an AngularJS module (returned by {@link module `angular.module()`}). The method takes two arguments:

  * The name of the Component (as string).
  * The Component config object. (Note that, unlike the `.directive()` method, this method does **not** take a factory function.)

<example name="heroComponentSimple" module="heroApp">
<file name="index.js">
  angular.module('heroApp', []).controller('MainCtrl', function MainCtrl() {
    this.hero = {
      name: 'Spawn'
    };
  });
</file>
<file name="heroDetail.js">
  angular.module('heroApp').component('heroDetail', {
    templateUrl: 'heroDetail.html',
    bindings: {
      hero: '='
    }
  });
</file>
<file name="index.html">
  <!-- components match only elements -->
  <div ng-controller="MainCtrl as ctrl">
    <b>Hero</b><br>
    <hero-detail hero="ctrl.hero"></hero-detail>
  </div>
</file>
<file name="heroDetail.html">
  <span>Name: {{$ctrl.hero.name}}</span>
</file>
</example>

It's also possible to add components via {@link $compileProvider#component} in a module's config phase.

### Comparison between Directive definition and Component definition

|                   | Directive            | Component       |

| link functions    | Yes                  | No       |
| multiElement      | Yes                  | No       |
| priority          | Yes                  | No       |
| replace           | Yes (deprecated)     | No       |
| require           | Yes                  | Yes      |

## Component-based application architecture

As already mentioned, the component helper makes it easier to structure your application with
a component-based architecture. But what makes a component beyond the options that
the component helper has?

- **Components only control their own View and Data:**
Components should never modify any data or DOM that is out of their own scope. Normally, in AngularJS
it is possible to modify data anywhere in the application through scope inheritance and watches. This
is practical, but can also lead to problems when it is not clear which part of the application is
responsible for modifying the data. That is why component directives use an isolate scope, so a whole
class of scope manipulation is not possible.

- **Components have a well-defined public API - Inputs and Outputs:**
However, scope isolation only goes so far, because AngularJS uses two-way binding. So if you pass
an object to a component like this - `bindings: {item: '='}`, and modify one of its properties, the
change will be reflected in the parent component. For components however, only the component that owns
the data should modify it, to make it easy to reason about what data is changed, and when. For that reason,
components should follow a few simple conventions:

  - Inputs should be using `<` and `@` bindings. The `<` symbol denotes {@link $compile#-scope- one-way bindings} which are
    available since 1.5. The difference to `=` is that the bound properties in the component scope are not watched, which means
    if you assign a new value to the property in the component scope, it will not update the parent scope. Note however, that both parent
    and component scope reference the same object, so if you are changing object properties or array elements in the
    component, the parent will still reflect that change.
    The general rule should therefore be to never change an object or array property in the component scope.
    `@` bindings can be used when the input is a string, especially when the value of the binding doesn't change.
    ```js
      bindings: {
        hero: '<',
        comment: '@'
      }
    ```
  - Outputs are realized with `&` bindings, which function as callbacks to component events.
    ```js
      bindings: {
        onDelete: '&',
        onUpdate: '&'
      }
    ```
  - Instead of manipulating Input Data, the component calls the correct Output Event with the changed data.
    For a deletion, that means the component doesn't delete the `hero` itself, but sends it back to
    the owner component via the correct event.
    ```html
        <!-- note that we use kebab-case for bindings in the template as usual -->
        <editable-field on-update="$ctrl.update('location', value)"></editable-field><br>
        <button ng-click="$ctrl.onDelete({hero: $ctrl.hero})">Delete</button>
    ```
  - That way, the parent component can decide what to do with the event (e.g. delete an item or update the properties)
    ```js
      ctrl.deleteHero(hero) {
        $http.delete(...).then(function() {
          var idx = ctrl.list.indexOf(hero);
          if (idx >= 0) {
            ctrl.list.splice(idx, 1);
          }
        });
      }
    ```

- **Components have a well-defined lifecycle:**
Each component can implement "lifecycle hooks". These are methods that will be called at certain points in the life
of the component. The following hook methods can be implemented:

  * `$onInit()` - Called on each controller after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and
    had their bindings initialized (and before the pre &amp; post linking functions for the directives on
    this element). This is a good place to put initialization code for your controller.
  * `$onChanges(changesObj)` - Called whenever one-way bindings are updated. The `changesObj` is a hash whose keys
    are the names of the bound properties that have changed, and the values are an object of the form
    `{ currentValue, previousValue, isFirstChange() }`. Use this hook to trigger updates within a component such as
    cloning the bound value to prevent accidental mutation of the outer value.
  * `$doCheck()` - Called on each turn of the digest cycle. Provides an opportunity to detect and act on
    changes. Any actions that you wish to take in response to the changes that you detect must be
    invoked from this hook; implementing this has no effect on when `$onChanges` is called. For example, this hook
    could be useful if you wish to perform a deep equality check, or to check a Date object, changes to which would not
    be detected by AngularJS's change detector and thus not trigger `$onChanges`. This hook is invoked with no arguments;
    if detecting changes, you must store the previous value(s) for comparison to the current values.
  * `$onDestroy()` - Called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed. Use this hook for releasing
    external resources, watches and event handlers.
  * `$postLink()` - Called after this controller's element and its children have been linked. Similar to the post-link
    function this hook can be used to set up DOM event handlers and do direct DOM manipulation.
    Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled and linked since
    they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been
    suspended until that occurs.
    This hook can be considered analogous to the `ngAfterViewInit` and `ngAfterContentInit` hooks in Angular.
    Since the compilation process is rather different in AngularJS there is no direct mapping and care should
    be taken when upgrading.

By implementing these methods, your component can hook into its lifecycle.

- **An application is a tree of components:**
Ideally, the whole application should be a tree of components that implement clearly defined inputs
and outputs, and minimize two-way data binding. That way, it's easier to predict when data changes and what the state
of a component is.

## Example of a component tree

The following example expands on the simple component example and incorporates the concepts we introduced
above:

Instead of an ngController, we now have a heroList component that holds the data of
different heroes, and creates a heroDetail for each of them.

The heroDetail component now contains new functionality:
- a delete button that calls the bound `onDelete` function of the heroList component
- an input to change the hero location, in the form of a reusable editableField component. Instead
of manipulating the hero object itself, it sends a changeset upwards to the heroDetail, which sends
it upwards to the heroList component, which updates the original data.

<example name="heroComponentTree" module="heroApp">
<file name="index.js">
  angular.module('heroApp', []);
</file>

<file name="heroList.js">
  function HeroListController($scope, $element, $attrs) {
    var ctrl = this;

    // This would be loaded by $http etc.
    ctrl.list = [
      {
        name: 'Superman',
        location: ''
      },
      {
        name: 'Batman',
        location: 'Wayne Manor'
      }
    ];

    ctrl.updateHero = function(hero, prop, value) {
      hero[prop] = value;
    };

    ctrl.deleteHero = function(hero) {
      var idx = ctrl.list.indexOf(hero);
      if (idx >= 0) {
        ctrl.list.splice(idx, 1);
      }
    };
  }

  angular.module('heroApp').component('heroList', {
    templateUrl: 'heroList.html',
    controller: HeroListController
  });

</file>

<file name="heroDetail.js">
  function HeroDetailController() {
    var ctrl = this;

    ctrl.delete = function() {
      ctrl.onDelete({hero: ctrl.hero});
    };

    ctrl.update = function(prop, value) {
      ctrl.onUpdate({hero: ctrl.hero, prop: prop, value: value});
    };
  }

  angular.module('heroApp').component('heroDetail', {
    templateUrl: 'heroDetail.html',
    controller: HeroDetailController,
    bindings: {
      hero: '<',
      onDelete: '&',
      onUpdate: '&'
    }
  });
</file>

<file name="editableField.js">

  function EditableFieldController($scope, $element, $attrs) {
    var ctrl = this;
    ctrl.editMode = false;

    ctrl.handleModeChange = function() {
      if (ctrl.editMode) {
        ctrl.onUpdate({value: ctrl.fieldValue});
        ctrl.fieldValueCopy = ctrl.fieldValue;
      }
      ctrl.editMode = !ctrl.editMode;
    };

    ctrl.reset = function() {
      ctrl.fieldValue = ctrl.fieldValueCopy;
    };

    ctrl.$onInit = function() {
      // Make a copy of the initial value to be able to reset it later
      ctrl.fieldValueCopy = ctrl.fieldValue;

      // Set a default fieldType
      if (!ctrl.fieldType) {
        ctrl.fieldType = 'text';
      }
    };
  }

  angular.module('heroApp').component('editableField', {
    templateUrl: 'editableField.html',
    controller: EditableFieldController,
    bindings: {
      fieldValue: '<',
      fieldType: '@?',
      onUpdate: '&'
    }
  });

  <button ng-click="$ctrl.handleModeChange()">{{$ctrl.editMode ? 'Save' : 'Edit'}}</button>
  <button ng-if="$ctrl.editMode" ng-click="$ctrl.reset()">Reset</button>
</file>
</example>

## Components as route templates
Components are also useful as route templates (e.g. when using {@link ngRoute ngRoute}). In a component-based
application, every view is a component:

```js
  var myMod = angular.module('myMod', ['ngRoute']);
  myMod.component('home', {
    template: '<h1>Home</h1><p>Hello, {{ $ctrl.user.name }} !</p>',
    controller: function() {
      this.user = {name: 'world'};
    }
  });
  myMod.config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.when('/', {
      template: '<home></home>'
    });
  });
```
<br />
When using {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider}, you can often avoid some
boilerplate, by passing the resolved route dependencies directly to the component. Since 1.5,
ngRoute automatically assigns the resolves to the route scope property `$resolve` (you can also
configure the property name via `resolveAs`). When using components, you can take advantage of this and pass resolves
directly into your component without creating an extra route controller:

```js
  var myMod = angular.module('myMod', ['ngRoute']);
  myMod.component('home', {
    template: '<h1>Home</h1><p>Hello, {{ $ctrl.user.name }} !</p>',
    bindings: {
      user: '<'
    }
  });
  myMod.config(function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.when('/', {
      template: '<home user="$resolve.user"></home>',
      resolve: {
        user: function($http) { return $http.get('...'); }
      }
    });
  });
```

## Intercomponent Communication

Directives can require the controllers of other directives to enable communication
between each other. This can be achieved in a component by providing an
object mapping for the `require` property. The object keys specify the property names under which
the required controllers (object values) will be bound to the requiring component's controller.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Note that the required controllers will not be available during the instantiation of the controller,
but they are guaranteed to be available just before the `$onInit` method is executed!
</div>

Here is a tab pane example built from components:

<example module="docsTabsExample" name="component-tabs-pane">
  <file name="script.js">
angular.module('docsTabsExample', [])
  .component('myTabs', {
    transclude: true,
    controller: function MyTabsController() {
      var panes = this.panes = [];
      this.select = function(pane) {
        angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
          pane.selected = false;
        });
        pane.selected = true;
      };
      this.addPane = function(pane) {
        if (panes.length === 0) {
          this.select(pane);
        }
        panes.push(pane);
      };
    },
    templateUrl: 'my-tabs.html'
  })
  .component('myPane', {
    transclude: true,
    require: {
      tabsCtrl: '^myTabs'
    },
    bindings: {
      title: '@'
    },
    controller: function() {
      this.$onInit = function() {
        this.tabsCtrl.addPane(this);
        console.log(this);
      };
    },
    templateUrl: 'my-pane.html'
  });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
  <my-tabs>
    <my-pane title="Hello">
      <h4>Hello</h4>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
    </my-pane>
    <my-pane title="World">
      <h4>World</h4>
      <em>Mauris elementum elementum enim at suscipit.</em>
      <p><a href ng-click="i = i + 1">counter: {{i || 0}}</a></p>
    </my-pane>
  </my-tabs>
  </file>
  <file name="my-tabs.html">
  <div class="tabbable">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
      <li ng-repeat="pane in $ctrl.panes" ng-class="{active:pane.selected}">
        <a href="" ng-click="$ctrl.select(pane)">{{pane.title}}</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="tab-content" ng-transclude></div>
  </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-pane.html">
    <div class="tab-pane" ng-show="$ctrl.selected" ng-transclude></div>
  </file>
</example>


## Unit-testing Component Controllers

The easiest way to unit-test a component controller is by using the
{@link ngMock.$componentController $componentController} that is included in {@link ngMock}. The
advantage of this method is that you do not have to create any DOM elements. The following example
shows how to do this for the `heroDetail` component from above.

The examples use the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework.

**Controller Test:**
```js
describe('HeroDetailController', function() {
  var $componentController;

  beforeEach(module('heroApp'));
  beforeEach(inject(function(_$componentController_) {
    $componentController = _$componentController_;
  }));

  it('should call the `onDelete` binding, when deleting the hero', function() {
    var onDeleteSpy = jasmine.createSpy('onDelete');
    var bindings = {hero: {}, onDelete: onDeleteSpy};
    var ctrl = $componentController('heroDetail', null, bindings);

    ctrl.delete();
    expect(onDeleteSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({hero: ctrl.hero});
  });

  it('should call the `onUpdate` binding, when updating a property', function() {
    var onUpdateSpy = jasmine.createSpy('onUpdate');
    var bindings = {hero: {}, onUpdate: onUpdateSpy};
    var ctrl = $componentController('heroDetail', null, bindings);

    ctrl.update('foo', 'bar');
    expect(onUpdateSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      hero: ctrl.hero,
      prop: 'foo',
      value: 'bar'
    });
  });

});
```

## A first example: Data binding

In the following example we will build a form to calculate the costs of an invoice in different currencies.

Let's start with input fields for quantity and cost whose values are multiplied to produce the total of the invoice:


<example name="guide-concepts-1" ng-app-included="true">
  <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-app ng-init="qty=1;cost=2">
        <b>Invoice:</b>
        <div>
          Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="qty">
        </div>
        <div>
          Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="cost">
        </div>
        <div>
          <b>Total:</b> {{qty * cost | currency}}
        </div>
      </div>
  </file>
</example>

Try out the Live Preview above, and then let's walk through the example and describe what's going on.

<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="img/guide/concepts-databinding1.png">

This looks like normal HTML, with some new markup. In AngularJS, a file like this is called a
<a name="template">{@link templates template}</a>. When AngularJS starts your application, it parses and
processes this new markup from the template using the <a name="compiler">{@link compiler compiler}</a>.
The loaded, transformed and rendered DOM is then called the <a name="view"></a>*view*.

The first kind of new markup are the <a name="directive">{@link directive directives}</a>.
They apply special behavior to attributes or elements in the HTML. In the example above we use the
{@link ng.directive:ngApp `ng-app`} attribute, which is linked to a directive that automatically
initializes our application. AngularJS also defines a directive for the {@link ng.directive:input `input`}
element that adds extra behavior to the element. The {@link ng.directive:ngModel `ng-model`} directive
stores/updates the value of the input field into/from a variable.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Custom directives to access the DOM**: In AngularJS, the only place where an application should access the DOM is
 within directives. This is important because artifacts that access the DOM are hard to test.
 If you need to access the DOM directly you should write a custom directive for this. The
 {@link directive directives guide} explains how to do this.
</div>

The second kind of new markup are the double curly braces `{{ expression | filter }}`:
When the compiler encounters this markup, it will replace it with the evaluated value of the markup.
An <a name="expression">{@link expression expression}</a> in a template is a JavaScript-like code snippet that allows
AngularJS to read and write variables. Note that those variables are not global variables.
Just like variables in a JavaScript function live in a scope,
AngularJS provides a <a name="scope">{@link scope scope}</a> for the variables accessible to expressions.
The values that are stored in variables on the scope are referred to as the <a name="model"></a>*model*
in the rest of the documentation.
Applied to the example above, the markup directs AngularJS to "take the data we got from the input widgets
and multiply them together".

The example above also contains a <a name="filter">{@link guide/filter filter}</a>.
A filter formats the value of an expression for display to the user.
In the example above, the filter {@link ng.filter:currency `currency`} formats a number
into an output that looks like money.

The important thing in the example is that AngularJS provides _live_ bindings:
Whenever the input values change, the value of the expressions are automatically
recalculated and the DOM is updated with their values.
The concept behind this is <a name="databinding">{@link databinding two-way data binding}</a>.


## Adding UI logic: Controllers

Let's add some more logic to the example that allows us to enter and calculate the costs in
different currencies and also pay the invoice.

<example name="guide-concepts-2" ng-app-included="true" >
  <file name="invoice1.js">
    angular.module('invoice1', [])
      .controller('InvoiceController', function InvoiceController() {
        this.qty = 1;
        this.cost = 2;
        this.inCurr = 'EUR';
        this.currencies = ['USD', 'EUR', 'CNY'];
        this.usdToForeignRates = {
          USD: 1,
          EUR: 0.74,
          CNY: 6.09
        };

        this.total = function total(outCurr) {
          return this.convertCurrency(this.qty * this.cost, this.inCurr, outCurr);
        };
        this.convertCurrency = function convertCurrency(amount, inCurr, outCurr) {
          return amount * this.usdToForeignRates[outCurr] / this.usdToForeignRates[inCurr];
        };
        this.pay = function pay() {
          window.alert('Thanks!');
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-app="invoice1" ng-controller="InvoiceController as invoice">
        <b>Invoice:</b>
        <div>
          Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.qty" required >
        </div>
        <div>
          Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.cost" required >
          <select ng-model="invoice.inCurr">
            <option ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">{{c}}</option>
          </select>
        </div>
        <div>
          <b>Total:</b>
          <span ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">
            {{invoice.total(c) | currency:c}}
          </span><br>
          <button class="btn" ng-click="invoice.pay()">Pay</button>
        </div>
      </div>
  </file>
</example>

What changed?

First, there is a new JavaScript file that contains a <a name="controller">{@link controller controller}</a>.
More accurately, the file specifies a constructor function that will be used to create the actual
controller instance. The purpose of controllers is to expose variables and functionality to
expressions and directives.

Besides the new file that contains the controller code, we also added an
{@link ng.directive:ngController `ng-controller`} directive to the HTML.
This directive tells AngularJS that the new `InvoiceController` is responsible for the element with the directive
and all of the element's children.
The syntax `InvoiceController as invoice` tells AngularJS to instantiate the controller
and save it in the variable `invoice` in the current scope.

We also changed all expressions in the page to read and write variables within that
controller instance by prefixing them with `invoice.` . The possible currencies are defined in the controller
and added to the template using {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ng-repeat`}.
As the controller contains a `total` function
we are also able to bind the result of that function to the DOM using `{{ invoice.total(...) }}`.

Again, this binding is live, i.e. the DOM will be automatically updated
whenever the result of the function changes.
The button to pay the invoice uses the directive {@link ng.directive:ngClick `ngClick`}. This will evaluate the
corresponding expression whenever the button is clicked.

In the new JavaScript file we are also creating a {@link concepts#module module}
at which we register the controller. We will talk about modules in the next section.

The following graphic shows how everything works together after we introduced the controller:

## View-independent business logic: Services

Right now, the `InvoiceController` contains all logic of our example. When the application grows it
is a good practice to move view-independent logic from the controller into a
<a name="service">{@link services service}</a>, so it can be reused by other parts
of the application as well. Later on, we could also change that service to load the exchange rates
from the web, e.g. by calling the [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io) exchange rate API, without changing the controller.

Let's refactor our example and move the currency conversion into a service in another file:

<example name="guide-concepts-2" ng-app-included="true">
  <file name="finance2.js">
    angular.module('finance2', [])
      .factory('currencyConverter', function() {
        var currencies = ['USD', 'EUR', 'CNY'];
        var usdToForeignRates = {
          USD: 1,
          EUR: 0.74,
          CNY: 6.09
        };
        var convert = function(amount, inCurr, outCurr) {
          return amount * usdToForeignRates[outCurr] / usdToForeignRates[inCurr];
        };

        return {
          currencies: currencies,
          convert: convert
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="invoice2.js">
    angular.module('invoice2', ['finance2'])
      .controller('InvoiceController', ['currencyConverter', function InvoiceController(currencyConverter) {
        this.qty = 1;
        this.cost = 2;
        this.inCurr = 'EUR';
        this.currencies = currencyConverter.currencies;

        this.total = function total(outCurr) {
          return currencyConverter.convert(this.qty * this.cost, this.inCurr, outCurr);
        };
        this.pay = function pay() {
          window.alert('Thanks!');
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-app="invoice2" ng-controller="InvoiceController as invoice">
        <b>Invoice:</b>
        <div>
          Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.qty" required >
        </div>
        <div>
          Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.cost" required >
          <select ng-model="invoice.inCurr">
            <option ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">{{c}}</option>
          </select>
        </div>
        <div>
          <b>Total:</b>
          <span ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">
            {{invoice.total(c) | currency:c}}
          </span><br>
          <button class="btn" ng-click="invoice.pay()">Pay</button>
        </div>
      </div>
  </file>
</example>

<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="img/guide/concepts-module-service.png">

What changed?

We moved the `convertCurrency` function and the definition of the existing currencies
into the new file `finance2.js`. But how does the controller
get a hold of the now separated function?

This is where <a name="di">{@link di Dependency Injection}</a> comes into play.
Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that
deals with how objects and functions get created and how they get a hold of their dependencies.
Everything within AngularJS (directives, filters, controllers,
services, ...) is created and wired using dependency injection. Within AngularJS,
the DI container is called the <a name="injector">{@link di injector}</a>.

To use DI, there needs to be a place where all the things that should work together are registered.
In AngularJS, this is the purpose of the <a name="module">{@link module modules}</a>.
When AngularJS starts, it will use the configuration of the module with the name defined by the `ng-app` directive,
including the configuration of all modules that this module depends on.

In the example above:
The template contains the directive `ng-app="invoice2"`. This tells AngularJS
to use the `invoice2` module as the main module for the application.
The code snippet `angular.module('invoice2', ['finance2'])`  specifies that the `invoice2` module depends on the
`finance2` module. By this, AngularJS uses the `InvoiceController` as well as the `currencyConverter` service.

Now that AngularJS knows of all the parts of the application, it needs to create them.
In the previous section we saw that controllers are created using a constructor function.
For services, there are multiple ways to specify how they are created
(see the {@link services service guide}).
In the example above, we are using an anonymous function as the factory function for the
`currencyConverter` service.
This function should return the `currencyConverter` service instance.

Back to the initial question: How does the `InvoiceController` get a reference to the `currencyConverter` function?
In AngularJS, this is done by simply defining arguments on the constructor function. With this, the injector
is able to create the objects in the right order and pass the previously created objects into the
factories of the objects that depend on them.
In our example, the `InvoiceController` has an argument named `currencyConverter`. By this, AngularJS knows about the
dependency between the controller and the service and calls the controller with the service instance as argument.

The last thing that changed in the example between the previous section and this section is that we
now pass an array to the `module.controller` function, instead of a plain function. The array first
contains the names of the service dependencies that the controller needs. The last entry
in the array is the controller constructor function.
AngularJS uses this array syntax to define the dependencies so that the DI also works after minifying
the code, which will most probably rename the argument name of the controller constructor function
to something shorter like `a`.

## Accessing the backend

Let's finish our example by fetching the exchange rates from the [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io) exchange rate API.
The following example shows how this is done with AngularJS:

<example name="guide-concepts-3" ng-app-included="true">
  <file name="invoice3.js">
    angular.module('invoice3', ['finance3'])
      .controller('InvoiceController', ['currencyConverter', function InvoiceController(currencyConverter) {
        this.qty = 1;
        this.cost = 2;
        this.inCurr = 'EUR';
        this.currencies = currencyConverter.currencies;

        this.total = function total(outCurr) {
          return currencyConverter.convert(this.qty * this.cost, this.inCurr, outCurr);
        };
        this.pay = function pay() {
          window.alert('Thanks!');
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="finance3.js">
    angular.module('finance3', [])
      .factory('currencyConverter', ['$http', function($http) {
        var currencies = ['USD', 'EUR', 'CNY'];
        var usdToForeignRates = {};

        var convert = function(amount, inCurr, outCurr) {
          return amount * usdToForeignRates[outCurr] / usdToForeignRates[inCurr];
        };

        var refresh = function() {
          var url = 'https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD&symbols=' + currencies.join(",");
          return $http.get(url).then(function(response) {
            usdToForeignRates = response.data.rates;
            usdToForeignRates['USD'] = 1;
          });
        };

        refresh();

        return {
          currencies: currencies,
          convert: convert
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-app="invoice3" ng-controller="InvoiceController as invoice">
        <b>Invoice:</b>
        <div>
          Quantity: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.qty" required >
        </div>
        <div>
          Costs: <input type="number" min="0" ng-model="invoice.cost" required >
          <select ng-model="invoice.inCurr">
            <option ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">{{c}}</option>
          </select>
        </div>
        <div>
          <b>Total:</b>
          <span ng-repeat="c in invoice.currencies">
            {{invoice.total(c) | currency:c}}
          </span><br>
          <button class="btn" ng-click="invoice.pay()">Pay</button>
        </div>
      </div>
  </file>
</example>

What changed?
Our `currencyConverter` service of the `finance` module now uses the {@link ng.$http `$http`}, a
built-in service provided by AngularJS for accessing a server backend. `$http` is a wrapper around
[`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)
and [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) transports.

# Understanding Controllers

In AngularJS, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript **constructor function** that is used to augment the
{@link scope AngularJS Scope}.

Controllers can be attached to the DOM in different ways. For each of them, AngularJS will
instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's **constructor function**:

- the {@link ng.directive:ngController ngController} directive. A new **child scope** will be
created and made available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function
as `$scope`.
- a route controller in a {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $route definition}.
- the controller of a {@link guide/directive regular directive},  or a
{@link guide/component component directive}.

If the controller has been attached using the `controller as` syntax then the controller instance will
be assigned to a property on the scope.

Use controllers to:

- Set up the initial state of the `$scope` object.
- Add behavior to the `$scope` object.

Do not use controllers to:

- Manipulate DOM — Controllers should contain only business logic.
  Putting any presentation logic into Controllers significantly affects its testability. AngularJS
  has {@link databinding databinding} for most cases and {@link guide/directive directives} to
  encapsulate manual DOM manipulation.
- Format input — Use {@link forms AngularJS form controls} instead.
- Filter output — Use {@link guide/filter AngularJS filters} instead.
- Share code or state across controllers — Use {@link services AngularJS
services} instead.
- Manage the life-cycle of other components (for example, to create service instances).

In general, a Controller shouldn't try to do too much. It should contain only the business logic
needed for a single view.

The most common way to keep Controllers slim is by encapsulating work that doesn't belong to
controllers into services and then using these services in Controllers via dependency injection.
This is discussed in the {@link di Dependency Injection}  and  {@link services
Services} sections of this guide.


## Setting up the initial state of a `$scope` object

Typically, when you create an application you need to set up the initial state for the AngularJS
`$scope`. You set up the initial state of a scope by attaching properties to the `$scope` object.
The properties contain the **view model** (the model that will be presented by the view).  All the
`$scope` properties will be available to the {@link templates template} at the point in the DOM where the Controller
is registered.

The following example demonstrates creating a `GreetingController`, which attaches a `greeting`
property containing the string `'Hola!'` to the `$scope`:

```js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('GreetingController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.greeting = 'Hola!';
}]);
```

We create an {@link module AngularJS Module}, `myApp`, for our application. Then we add the controller's
constructor function to the module using the `.controller()` method. This keeps the controller's
constructor function out of the global scope.

<div class="alert alert-info">
We have used an **inline injection annotation** to explicitly specify the dependency
of the Controller on the `$scope` service provided by AngularJS. See the guide on
{@link guide/di Dependency Injection} for more information.
</div>

We attach our controller to the DOM using the `ng-controller` directive. The `greeting` property can
now be data-bound to the template:

```js
<div ng-controller="GreetingController">
  {{ greeting }}
</div>
```


## Adding Behavior to a Scope Object

In order to react to events or execute computation in the view we must provide behavior to the
scope. We add behavior to the scope by attaching methods to the `$scope` object.  These methods are
then available to be called from the template/view.

The following example uses a Controller to add a method, which doubles a number, to the scope:

```js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

myApp.controller('DoubleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
  $scope.double = function(value) { return value * 2; };
}]);
```

Once the Controller has been attached to the DOM, the `double` method can be invoked in an AngularJS
expression in the template:

```js
<div ng-controller="DoubleController">
  Two times <input ng-model="num"> equals {{ double(num) }}
</div>
```

As discussed in the {@link concepts Concepts} section of this guide, any
objects (or primitives) assigned to the scope become model properties. Any methods assigned to
the scope are available in the template/view, and can be invoked via AngularJS expressions
and `ng` event handler directives (e.g. {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick}).

## Simple Spicy Controller Example

To illustrate further how Controller components work in AngularJS, let's create a little app with the
following components:

- A {@link templates template} with two buttons and a simple message
- A model consisting of a string named `spice`
- A Controller with two functions that set the value of `spice`

The message in our template contains a binding to the `spice` model which, by default, is set to the
string "very". Depending on which button is clicked, the `spice` model is set to `chili` or
`jalapeño`, and the message is automatically updated by data-binding.

<example module="spicyApp1" name="controller-spicy-1">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="SpicyController">
     <button ng-click="chiliSpicy()">Chili</button>
     <button ng-click="jalapenoSpicy()">Jalapeño</button>
     <p>The food is {{spice}} spicy!</p>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="app.js">
    var myApp = angular.module('spicyApp1', []);

    myApp.controller('SpicyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.spice = 'very';

        $scope.chiliSpicy = function() {
            $scope.spice = 'chili';
        };

        $scope.jalapenoSpicy = function() {
            $scope.spice = 'jalapeño';
        };
    }]);
  </file>
</example>

Things to notice in the example above:

- The `ng-controller` directive is used to (implicitly) create a scope for our template, and the
scope is augmented (managed) by the `SpicyController` Controller.
- `SpicyController` is just a plain JavaScript function. As an (optional) naming convention the name
starts with capital letter and ends with "Controller".
- Assigning a property to `$scope` creates or updates the model.
- Controller methods can be created through direct assignment to scope (see the `chiliSpicy` method)
- The Controller methods and properties are available in the template (for both the `<div>` element and
its children).

## Spicy Arguments Example

Controller methods can also take arguments, as demonstrated in the following variation of the
previous example.

<example module="spicyApp2" name="controller-spicy-2">
  <file name="index.html">
  <div ng-controller="SpicyController">
   <input ng-model="customSpice">
   <button ng-click="spicy('chili')">Chili</button>
   <button ng-click="spicy(customSpice)">Custom spice</button>
   <p>The food is {{spice}} spicy!</p>
  </div>
  </file>
  <file name="app.js">
    var myApp = angular.module('spicyApp2', []);

    myApp.controller('SpicyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customSpice = 'wasabi';
        $scope.spice = 'very';

        $scope.spicy = function(spice) {
            $scope.spice = spice;
        };
    }]);
  </file>
</example>

Notice that the `SpicyController` Controller now defines just one method called `spicy`, which takes one
argument called `spice`. The template then refers to this Controller method and passes in a string
constant `'chili'` in the binding for the first button and a model property `customSpice` (bound to an
input box) in the second button.

## Scope Inheritance Example

It is common to attach Controllers at different levels of the DOM hierarchy.  Since the
{@link ng.directive:ngController ng-controller} directive creates a new child scope, we get a
hierarchy of scopes that inherit from each other.  The `$scope` that each Controller receives will
have access to properties and methods defined by Controllers higher up the hierarchy.
See [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes) for
more information about scope inheritance.

<example module="scopeInheritance" name="controller-scope-inheritance">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div class="spicy">
      <div ng-controller="MainController">
        <p>Good {{timeOfDay}}, {{name}}!</p>

        <div ng-controller="ChildController">
          <p>Good {{timeOfDay}}, {{name}}!</p>

          <div ng-controller="GrandChildController">
            <p>Good {{timeOfDay}}, {{name}}!</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="app.css">
    div.spicy div {
      padding: 10px;
      border: solid 2px blue;
    }
  </file>
  <file name="app.js">
      var myApp = angular.module('scopeInheritance', []);
      myApp.controller('MainController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.timeOfDay = 'morning';
        $scope.name = 'Nikki';
      }]);
      myApp.controller('ChildController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Mattie';
      }]);
      myApp.controller('GrandChildController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.timeOfDay = 'evening';
        $scope.name = 'Gingerbread Baby';
      }]);
  </file>
</example>

Notice how we nested three `ng-controller` directives in our template. This will result in four
scopes being created for our view:

- The root scope
- The `MainController` scope, which contains `timeOfDay` and `name` properties
- The `ChildController` scope, which inherits the `timeOfDay` property but overrides (shadows) the
  `name` property from the previous scope
- The `GrandChildController` scope, which overrides (shadows) both the `timeOfDay` property defined
  in `MainController` and the `name` property defined in `ChildController`

Inheritance works with methods in the same way as it does with properties. So in our previous
examples, all of the properties could be replaced with methods that return string values.


## Testing Controllers

Although there are many ways to test a Controller, one of the best conventions, shown below,
involves injecting the {@link ng.$rootScope $rootScope} and {@link ng.$controller $controller}:

**Controller Definition:**
```js
    var myApp = angular.module('myApp',[]);

    myApp.controller('MyController', function($scope) {
      $scope.spices = [{"name":"pasilla", "spiciness":"mild"},
                       {"name":"jalapeno", "spiciness":"hot hot hot!"},
                       {"name":"habanero", "spiciness":"LAVA HOT!!"}];
      $scope.spice = "habanero";
    });
```

**Controller Test:**
```js
describe('myController function', function() {

  describe('myController', function() {
    var $scope;

    beforeEach(module('myApp'));

    beforeEach(inject(function($rootScope, $controller) {
      $scope = $rootScope.$new();
      $controller('MyController', {$scope: $scope});
    }));

    it('should create "spices" model with 3 spices', function() {
      expect($scope.spices.length).toBe(3);
    });

    it('should set the default value of spice', function() {
      expect($scope.spice).toBe('habanero');
    });
  });
});
```


If you need to test a nested Controller you  must create the same scope hierarchy
in your test that exists in the DOM:

```js
describe('state', function() {
    var mainScope, childScope, grandChildScope;

    beforeEach(module('myApp'));

    beforeEach(inject(function($rootScope, $controller) {
        mainScope = $rootScope.$new();
        $controller('MainController', {$scope: mainScope});
        childScope = mainScope.$new();
        $controller('ChildController', {$scope: childScope});
        grandChildScope = childScope.$new();
        $controller('GrandChildController', {$scope: grandChildScope});
    }));

    it('should have over and selected', function() {
        expect(mainScope.timeOfDay).toBe('morning');
        expect(mainScope.name).toBe('Nikki');
        expect(childScope.timeOfDay).toBe('morning');
        expect(childScope.name).toBe('Mattie');
        expect(grandChildScope.timeOfDay).toBe('evening');
        expect(grandChildScope.name).toBe('Gingerbread Baby');
    });
});
```

* `ng-binding`
  - **Usage:** AngularJS applies this class to any element that is attached to a data binding, via `ng-bind` or
    `{{}}` curly braces, for example. (see {@link guide/databinding databinding} guide)

* `ng-invalid`, `ng-valid`
  - **Usage:** AngularJS applies this class to a form control widget element if that element's input does
    not pass validation. (see {@link ng.directive:input input} directive)

* `ng-pristine`, `ng-dirty`
  - **Usage:** AngularJS {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel} directive applies `ng-pristine` class

# Data Binding

Data-binding in AngularJS apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view
components.  The way that AngularJS implements data-binding lets you treat the model as the
single-source-of-truth in your application.  The view is a projection of the model at all times.
When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.

## Data Binding in Classical Template Systems

<img class="right" src="img/One_Way_Data_Binding.png"/><br />
Most templating systems bind data in only one direction: they merge template and model components
together into a view. After the merge occurs, changes to the model
or related sections of the view are NOT automatically reflected in the view. Worse, any changes
that the user makes to the view are not reflected in the model. This means that the developer has
to write code that constantly syncs the view with the model and the model with the view.

## Data Binding in AngularJS Templates

<img class="right" src="img/Two_Way_Data_Binding.png"/><br />
AngularJS templates work differently. First the template (which is the uncompiled HTML along with
any additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser. The compilation step produces a
live view. Any changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model, and any changes in
the model are propagated to the view. The model is the single-source-of-truth for the application
state, greatly simplifying the programming model for the developer. You can think of
the view as simply an instant projection of your model.

Because the view is just a projection of the model, the controller is completely separated from the
view and unaware of it. This makes testing a snap because it is easy to test your controller in
isolation without the view and the related DOM/browser dependency.

# Decorators in AngularJS

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  **NOTE:** This guide is targeted towards developers who are already familiar with AngularJS basics.
  If you're just getting started, we recommend the {@link tutorial/ tutorial} first.
</div>

## What are decorators?

Decorators are a design pattern that is used to separate modification or *decoration* of a class without modifying the
original source code. In AngularJS, decorators are functions that allow a service, directive or filter to be modified
prior to its usage.

## How to use decorators

There are two ways to register decorators

- `$provide.decorator`, and
- `module.decorator`

Each provide access to a `$delegate`, which is the instantiated service/directive/filter, prior to being passed to the
service that required it.

### $provide.decorator

The {@link api/auto/service/$provide#decorator decorator function} allows access to a $delegate of the service once it
has been instantiated. For example:

```js
angular.module('myApp', [])

.config([ '$provide', function($provide) {

  $provide.decorator('$log', [
    '$delegate',
    function $logDecorator($delegate) {

      var originalWarn = $delegate.warn;
      $delegate.warn = function decoratedWarn(msg) {
        msg = 'Decorated Warn: ' + msg;
        originalWarn.apply($delegate, arguments);
      };

      return $delegate;
    }
  ]);
}]);
```

After the `$log` service has been instantiated the decorator is fired. The decorator function has a `$delegate` object
injected to provide access to the service that matches the selector in the decorator. This `$delegate` will be the
service you are decorating. The return value of the function *provided to the decorator* will take place of the service,
directive, or filter being decorated.

<hr>

The `$delegate` may be either modified or completely replaced. Given a service `myService` with a method `someFn`, the
following could all be viable solutions:


#### Completely Replace the $delegate
```js
angular.module('myApp', [])

.config([ '$provide', function($provide) {

  $provide.decorator('myService', [
    '$delegate',
    function myServiceDecorator($delegate) {

      var myDecoratedService = {
        // new service object to replace myService
      };
      return myDecoratedService;
    }
  ]);
}]);
```

#### Patch the $delegate
```js
angular.module('myApp', [])

.config([ '$provide', function($provide) {

  $provide.decorator('myService', [
    '$delegate',
    function myServiceDecorator($delegate) {

      var someFn = $delegate.someFn;

      function aNewFn() {
        // new service function
        someFn.apply($delegate, arguments);
      }

      $delegate.someFn = aNewFn;
      return $delegate;
    }
  ]);
}]);
```

#### Augment the $delegate
```js
angular.module('myApp', [])

.config([ '$provide', function($provide) {

  $provide.decorator('myService', [
    '$delegate',
    function myServiceDecorator($delegate) {

      function helperFn() {
        // an additional fn to add to the service
      }

      $delegate.aHelpfulAddition = helperFn;
      return $delegate;
    }
  ]);
}]);
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note that whatever is returned by the decorator function will replace that which is being decorated. For example, a
  missing return statement will wipe out the entire object being decorated.
</div>

<hr>

Decorators have different rules for different services. This is because services are registered in different ways.
Services are selected by name, however filters and directives are selected by appending `"Filter"` or `"Directive"` to
the end of the name. The `$delegate` provided is dictated by the type of service.

| Service Type | Selector                      | $delegate                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Service      | `serviceName`                 | The `object` or `function` returned by the service                    |
| Directive    | `directiveName + 'Directive'` | An `Array.<DirectiveObject>`<sub>{@link guide/decorators#drtvArray 1}</sub> |
| Filter       | `filterName + 'Filter'`       | The `function` returned by the filter                                 |

<small id="drtvArray">1. Multiple directives may be registered to the same selector/name</small>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  **NOTE:** Developers should take care in how and why they are modifying the `$delegate` for the service. Not only
  should expectations for the consumer be kept, but some functionality (such as directive registration) does not take
  place after decoration, but during creation/registration of the original service. This means, for example, that
  an action such as pushing a directive object to a directive `$delegate` will likely result in unexpected behavior.

  Furthermore, great care should be taken when decorating core services, directives, or filters as this may unexpectedly
  or adversely affect the functionality of the framework.
</div>

### module.decorator

This {@link api/ng/type/angular.Module#decorator function} is the same as the `$provide.decorator` function except it is
exposed through the module API. This allows you to separate your decorator patterns from your module config blocks.

Like with `$provide.decorator`, the `module.decorator` function runs during the config phase of the app. That means
you can define a `module.decorator` before the decorated service is defined.

Since you can apply multiple decorators, it is noteworthy that decorator application always follows order
of declaration:

- If a service is decorated by both `$provide.decorator` and `module.decorator`, the decorators are applied in order:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .config(function($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('theFactory', provideDecoratorFn); // runs first
  })
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn); // runs seconds
```

- If the service has been declared multiple times, a decorator will decorate the service that has been declared
last:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn)
  .factory('theFactory', theOtherFactoryFn);

// `theOtherFactoryFn` is selected as 'theFactory' provider and it is decorated via `moduleDecoratorFn`.
```

## Example Applications

The following sections provide examples each of a service decorator, a directive decorator, and a filter decorator.

### Service Decorator Example

This example shows how we can replace the $log service with our own to display log messages.

<example module="myServiceDecorator" name="service-decorator">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('myServiceDecorator', []).

      controller('Ctrl', [
        '$scope',
        '$log',
        '$timeout',
        function($scope, $log, $timeout) {
          var types = ['error', 'warn', 'log', 'info' ,'debug'], i;

          for (i = 0; i < types.length; i++) {
            $log[types[i]](types[i] + ': message ' + (i + 1));
          }

          $timeout(function() {
            $log.info('info: message logged in timeout');
          });
        }
      ]).

      directive('myLog', [
        '$log',
        function($log) {
          return {
            restrict: 'E',
            template: '<ul id="myLog"><li ng-repeat="l in myLog" class="{{l.type}}">{{l.message}}</li></ul>',
            scope: {},
            compile: function() {
              return function(scope) {
                scope.myLog = $log.stack;
              };
            }
          };
        }
      ]).

      config([
        '$provide',
        function($provide) {

          $provide.decorator('$log', [
            '$delegate',
            function logDecorator($delegate) {

              var myLog = {
                warn: function(msg) {
                  log(msg, 'warn');
                },
                error: function(msg) {
                  log(msg, 'error');
                },
                info: function(msg) {
                  log(msg, 'info');
                },
                debug: function(msg) {
                  log(msg, 'debug');
                },
                log: function(msg) {
                  log(msg, 'log');
                },
                stack: []
              };

              function log(msg, type) {
                myLog.stack.push({ type: type, message: msg.toString() });
                if (console && console[type]) console[type](msg);
              }

              return myLog;

            }
          ]);

        }
      ]);
  </file>

  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <h1>Logs</h1>
      <my-log></my-log>

    li.warn { color: yellow; }
    li.error { color: red; }
    li.info { color: blue }
    li.log { color: black }
    li.debug { color: green }
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should display log messages in dom', function() {
      element.all(by.repeater('l in myLog')).count().then(function(count) {
        expect(count).toEqual(6);
      });
    });
  </file>
</example>

### Directive Decorator Example

Failed interpolated expressions in `ng-href` attributes can easily go unnoticed. We can decorate `ngHref` to warn us of
those conditions.

<example module="urlDecorator" name="directive-decorator">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('urlDecorator', []).

      controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.id = 3;
        $scope.warnCount = 0; // for testing
      }]).

      config(['$provide', function($provide) {

        // matchExpressions looks for interpolation markup in the directive attribute, extracts the expressions
        // from that markup (if they exist) and returns an array of those expressions
        function matchExpressions(str) {
          var exps = str.match(/{{([^}]+)}}/g);

          // if there isn't any, get out of here
          if (exps === null) return;

          exps = exps.map(function(exp) {
            var prop = exp.match(/[^{}]+/);
            return prop === null ? null : prop[0];
          });

          return exps;
        }

        // remember: directives must be selected by appending 'Directive' to the directive selector
        $provide.decorator('ngHrefDirective', [
          '$delegate',
          '$log',
          '$parse',
          function($delegate, $log, $parse) {

            // store the original link fn
            var originalLinkFn = $delegate[0].link;

            // replace the compile fn
            $delegate[0].compile = function(tElem, tAttr) {

              // store the original exp in the directive attribute for our warning message
              var originalExp = tAttr.ngHref;

              // get the interpolated expressions
              var exps = matchExpressions(originalExp);

              // create and store the getters using $parse
              var getters = exps.map(function(exp) {
                return exp && $parse(exp);
              });

              return function newLinkFn(scope, elem, attr) {
                // fire the originalLinkFn
                originalLinkFn.apply($delegate[0], arguments);

                // observe the directive attr and check the expressions
                attr.$observe('ngHref', function(val) {

                  // if we have getters and getters is an array...
                  if (getters && angular.isArray(getters)) {

                    // loop through the getters and process them
                    angular.forEach(getters, function(g, idx) {

                      // if val is truthy, then the warning won't log
                      var val = angular.isFunction(g) ? g(scope) : true;
                      if (!val) {
                        $log.warn('NgHref Warning: "' + exps[idx] + '" in the expression "' + originalExp +
                          '" is falsy!');

                        scope.warnCount++; // for testing
                      }

                    });

                  }

                });

              };

            };

            // get rid of the old link function since we return a link function in compile
            delete $delegate[0].link;

            // return the $delegate
            return $delegate;

          }

        ]);

      }]);
  </file>

  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <a ng-href="/products/{{ id }}/view" id="id3">View Product {{ id }}</a>
      - <strong>id === 3</strong>, so no warning<br>
      <a ng-href="/products/{{ id + 5 }}/view" id="id8">View Product {{ id + 5 }}</a>

      <a ng-href="/products/{{ someOtherId + 5 }}/view" id="someOtherId5">View Product {{ someOtherId + 5 }}</a>
      - <strong>someOtherId + 5 === 5</strong>, so no warning<br>
      <div>Warn Count: {{ warnCount }}</div>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should warn when an expression in the interpolated value is falsy', function() {
      var id3 = element(by.id('id3'));
      var id8 = element(by.id('id8'));
      var someOther = element(by.id('someOtherId'));
      var someOther5 = element(by.id('someOtherId5'));

      expect(id3.getText()).toEqual('View Product 3');
      expect(id3.getAttribute('href')).toContain('/products/3/view');

      expect(id8.getText()).toEqual('View Product 8');
      expect(id8.getAttribute('href')).toContain('/products/8/view');

      expect(someOther.getText()).toEqual('View Product');
      expect(someOther.getAttribute('href')).toContain('/products//view');

      expect(someOther5.getText()).toEqual('View Product 5');
      expect(someOther5.getAttribute('href')).toContain('/products/5/view');

      expect(element(by.binding('warnCount')).getText()).toEqual('Warn Count: 1');
    });
  </file>
</example>

### Filter Decorator Example

Let's say we have created an app that uses the default format for many of our `Date` filters. Suddenly requirements have
changed (that never happens) and we need all of our default dates to be `'shortDate'` instead of `'mediumDate'`.

<example module="filterDecorator" name="filter-decorator">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('filterDecorator', []).

      controller('Ctrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.genesis = new Date(2010, 0, 5);
        $scope.ngConf = new Date(2016, 4, 4);
      }]).

      config(['$provide', function($provide) {

        $provide.decorator('dateFilter', [
          '$delegate',
          function dateDecorator($delegate) {

            // store the original filter
            var originalFilter = $delegate;

            // return our filter
            return shortDateDefault;

            // shortDateDefault sets the format to shortDate if it is falsy
            function shortDateDefault(date, format, timezone) {
              if (!format) format = 'shortDate';

              // return the result of the original filter
              return originalFilter(date, format, timezone);
            }

          }

        ]);

      }]);
  </file>

  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Ctrl">
      <div id="genesis">Initial Commit default to short date: {{ genesis | date }}</div>
      <div>ng-conf 2016 default short date: {{ ngConf | date }}</div>
      <div id="ngConf">ng-conf 2016 with full date format: {{ ngConf | date:'fullDate' }}</div>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should default date filter to short date format', function() {
      expect(element(by.id('genesis')).getText())
        .toMatch(/Initial Commit default to short date: \d{1,2}\/\d{1,2}\/\d{2}/);
    });

    it('should still allow dates to be formatted', function() {
      expect(element(by.id('ngConf')).getText())
        .toMatch(/ng-conf 2016 with full date format: [A-Za-z]+, [A-Za-z]+ \d{1,2}, \d{4}/);

@ngdoc overview
@name  Dependency Injection
@sortOrder 250
@description

# Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how components get hold of
their dependencies.

The AngularJS injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, resolving their dependencies,
and providing them to other components as requested.


## Using Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection is pervasive throughout AngularJS. You can use it when defining components
or when providing `run` and `config` blocks for a module.

- {@link angular.Module#service Services}, {@link angular.Module#directive directives},
{@link angular.Module#filter filters}, and {@link angular.Module#animation animations} are
defined by an injectable factory method or constructor function, and can be injected with
"services", "values", and "constants" as dependencies.

- {@link ng.$controller Controllers} are defined by a constructor function, which can be injected
with any of the "service" and "value" as dependencies, but they can also be provided with
"special dependencies". See {@link di#controllers Controllers} below for a list of these
special dependencies.

- The {@link angular.Module#run `run`} method accepts a function, which can be injected with
"services", "values" and, "constants" as dependencies. Note that you cannot inject "providers"
into `run` blocks.

- The {@link angular.Module#config `config`} method accepts a function, which can be injected with
"providers" and "constants" as dependencies. Note that you cannot inject "services" or
"values" into configuration.

- The {@link angular.Module#provider `provider`} method can only be injected with other "providers".
However, only those that have been **registered beforehand** can be injected. This is different
from services, where the order of registration does not matter.

See {@link module#module-loading Modules} for more details about `run` and `config`
blocks and {@link guide/providers Providers} for more information about the different provider
types.


### Factory Methods

The way you define a directive, service, or filter is with a factory function.
The factory methods are registered with modules. The recommended way of declaring factories is:

```js
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .factory('serviceId', ['depService', function(depService) {
    // ...
  }])
  .directive('directiveName', ['depService', function(depService) {
    // ...
  }])
  .filter('filterName', ['depService', function(depService) {
    // ...
  }]);
```

### Module Methods

We can specify functions to run at configuration and run time for a module by calling the `config`
and `run` methods. These functions are injectable with dependencies just like the factory functions
above.

```js
angular.module('myModule', [])
  .config(['depProvider', function(depProvider) {
    // ...
  }])
  .run(['depService', function(depService) {
    // ...
  }]);
```

### Controllers

Controllers are "classes" or "constructor functions" that are responsible for providing the
application behavior that supports the declarative markup in the template. The recommended way of
declaring Controllers is using the array notation:

```js
someModule.controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'dep1', 'dep2', function($scope, dep1, dep2) {
  ...
  $scope.aMethod = function() {
    ...
  }
  ...
}]);
```

Unlike services, there can be many instances of the same type of controller in an application.

Moreover, additional dependencies are made available to Controllers:

* {@link scope `$scope`}: Controllers are associated with an element in the DOM and so are
  provided with access to the {@link scope scope}. Other components (like services) only have
  access to the {@link $rootScope `$rootScope`} service.
* {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#when resolves}: If a controller is instantiated as part of a route,
  then any values that are resolved as part of the route are made available for injection into the
  controller.


## Dependency Annotation

AngularJS invokes certain functions (like service factories and controllers) via the injector.
You need to annotate these functions so that the injector knows what services to inject into
the function. There are three ways of annotating your code with service name information:

- Using the inline array annotation (preferred)
- Using the `$inject` property annotation
- Implicitly from the function parameter names (has caveats)

### Inline Array Annotation

This is the preferred way to annotate application components. This is how the examples in the
documentation are written.

For example:

```js
someModule.controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'greeter', function($scope, greeter) {
  // ...
}]);
```

Here we pass an array whose elements consist of a list of strings (the names of the dependencies)
followed by the function itself.

When using this type of annotation, take care to keep the annotation array in sync with the
parameters in the function declaration.

### `$inject` Property Annotation

To allow the minifiers to rename the function parameters and still be able to inject the right services,
the function needs to be annotated with the `$inject` property. The `$inject` property is an array
of service names to inject.

```js
var MyController = function($scope, greeter) {
  // ...
}
MyController.$inject = ['$scope', 'greeter'];
someModule.controller('MyController', MyController);
```

In this scenario the ordering of the values in the `$inject` array must match the ordering of the
parameters in `MyController`.

Just like with the array annotation, you'll need to take care to keep the `$inject` in sync with
the parameters in the function declaration.

### Implicit Annotation

<div class="alert alert-danger">
**Careful:** If you plan to [minify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming&#41;)
your code, your service names will get renamed and break your app.
</div>

The simplest way to get hold of the dependencies is to assume that the function parameter names
are the names of the dependencies.

```js
someModule.controller('MyController', function($scope, greeter) {
  // ...
});
```

Given a function, the injector can infer the names of the services to inject by examining the
function declaration and extracting the parameter names. In the above example, `$scope` and
`greeter` are two services which need to be injected into the function.

One advantage of this approach is that there's no array of names to keep in sync with the
function parameters. You can also freely reorder dependencies.

However this method will not work with JavaScript minifiers/obfuscators because of how they
rename parameters.

Tools like [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) let you use implicit dependency
annotations in your app and automatically add inline array annotations prior to minifying.
If you decide to take this approach, you probably want to use `ng-strict-di`.

Because of these caveats, we recommend avoiding this style of annotation.


## Using Strict Dependency Injection

You can add an `ng-strict-di` directive on the same element as `ng-app` to opt into strict DI mode:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="myApp" ng-strict-di>
<body>
  I can add: {{ 1 + 2 }}.
  <script src="angular.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Strict mode throws an error whenever a service tries to use implicit annotations.

Consider this module, which includes a `willBreak` service that uses implicit DI:

```js
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .factory('willBreak', function($rootScope) {
    // $rootScope is implicitly injected
  })
  .run(['willBreak', function(willBreak) {
    // AngularJS will throw when this runs
  }]);
```

When the `willBreak` service is instantiated, AngularJS will throw an error because of strict mode.
This is useful when using a tool like [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) to
ensure that all of your application components have annotations.

If you're using manual bootstrapping, you can also use strict DI by providing `strictDi: true` in
the optional config argument:

```js
angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp'], {
  strictDi: true
});
```



## Why Dependency Injection?

This section motivates and explains AngularJS's use of DI. For how to use DI, see above.

For in-depth discussion about DI, see
[Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) at Wikipedia,
[Inversion of Control](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) by Martin Fowler,
or read about DI in your favorite software design pattern book.

There are only three ways a component (object or function) can get a hold of its dependencies:

  1. The component can create the dependency, typically using the `new` operator.
  2. The component can look up the dependency, by referring to a global variable.
  3. The component can have the dependency passed to it where it is needed.

The first two options of creating or looking up dependencies are not optimal because they hard
code the dependency to the component. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to modify the
dependencies. This is especially problematic in tests, where it is often desirable to provide mock
dependencies for test isolation.

The third option is the most viable, since it removes the responsibility of locating the
dependency from the component. The dependency is simply handed to the component.

```js
function SomeClass(greeter) {
  this.greeter = greeter;
}

SomeClass.prototype.doSomething = function(name) {
  this.greeter.greet(name);
}
```

In the above example `SomeClass` is not concerned with creating or locating the `greeter`
dependency, it is simply handed the `greeter` when it is instantiated.

This is desirable, but it puts the responsibility of getting hold of the dependency on the
code that constructs `SomeClass`.

<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="img/guide/concepts-module-injector.png">

To manage the responsibility of dependency creation, each AngularJS application has an {@link
angular.injector injector}. The injector is a
[service locator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern) that is responsible for
construction and lookup of dependencies.

Here is an example of using the injector service:

First create an AngularJS module that will hold the service definition. (The empty array passed as
the second parameter means that this module does not depend on any other modules.)

```js
// Create a module to hold the service definition
var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
```

Teach the injector how to build a `greeter` service, which is just an object that contains a `greet`
method. Notice that `greeter` is dependent on the `$window` service, which will be provided
(injected into `greeter`) by the injector.

```js
// Define the `greeter` service
myModule.factory('greeter', function($window) {
  return {
    greet: function(text) {
      $window.alert(text);
    }
  };
});
```

Create a new injector that can provide components defined in our `myModule` module and request our
`greeter` service from the injector. (This is usually done automatically by AngularJS bootstrap).

```js
var injector = angular.injector(['ng', 'myModule']);
var greeter = injector.get('greeter');
```

Asking for dependencies solves the issue of hard coding, but it also means that the injector needs
to be passed throughout the application. Passing the injector breaks the
[Law of Demeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter). To remedy this, we use a declarative
notation in our HTML templates, to hand the responsibility of creating components over to the
injector, as in this example:

```html
<div ng-controller="MyController">
  <button ng-click="sayHello()">Hello</button>
</div>
```

```js
function MyController($scope, greeter) {
  $scope.sayHello = function() {
    greeter.greet('Hello World');
  };
}
```

When AngularJS compiles the HTML, it processes the `ng-controller` directive, which in turn
asks the injector to create an instance of the controller and its dependencies.

```js
injector.instantiate(MyController);
```

This is all done behind the scenes. Notice that by having the `ng-controller` ask the injector to
instantiate the class, it can satisfy all of the dependencies of `MyController` without the
controller ever knowing about the injector.

This is the best outcome. The application code simply declares the dependencies it needs, without
having to deal with the injector. This setup does not break the Law of Demeter.

# Creating Custom Directives

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** this guide is targeted towards developers who are already familiar with AngularJS basics.
If you're just getting started, we recommend the {@link tutorial/ tutorial} first.
If you're looking for the **directives API**, you can find it in the
{@link ng.$compile `$compile` API docs}.
</div>


This document explains when you'd want to create your own directives in your AngularJS app, and
how to implement them.


## What are Directives?

At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element
name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's **HTML compiler** ({@link ng.$compile `$compile`})
to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform
the DOM element and its children.

AngularJS comes with a set of these directives built-in, like `ngBind`, `ngModel`, and `ngClass`.
Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for AngularJS to use.
When AngularJS {@link guide/bootstrap bootstraps} your application, the
{@link guide/compiler HTML compiler} traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**What does it mean to "compile" an HTML template?**

For AngularJS, "compilation" means attaching directives to the HTML to make it interactive.
The reason we use the term "compile" is that the recursive process of attaching directives
mirrors the process of compiling source code in
[compiled programming languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_languages).
</div>


## Matching Directives

Before we can write a directive, we need to know how AngularJS's {@link guide/compiler HTML compiler}
determines when to use a given directive.

Similar to the terminology used when an [element **matches** a selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.matches), we say an element **matches** a
directive when the directive is part of its declaration.

In the following example, we say that the `<input>` element **matches** the `ngModel` directive

```html
<input ng-model="foo">
```

The following `<input>` element also **matches** `ngModel`:

```html
<input data-ng-model="foo">
```

And the following `<person>` element **matches** the `person` directive:

```html
<person>{{name}}</person>
```

### Normalization

AngularJS **normalizes** an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which
directives. We typically refer to directives by their case-sensitive
[camelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) **normalized** name (e.g. `ngModel`).
However, since HTML is case-insensitive, we refer to directives in the DOM by lower-case
forms, typically using [dash-delimited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles)
attributes on DOM elements (e.g. `ng-model`).

The **normalization** process is as follows:

1. Strip `x-` and `data-` from the front of the element/attributes.
2. Convert the `:`, `-`, or `_`-delimited name to `camelCase`.

For example, the following forms are all equivalent and match the {@link ngBind} directive:

<example module="docsBindExample" name="directive-bind">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      Hello <input ng-model='name'> <hr/>
      <span ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
      <span ng:bind="name"></span> <br/>
      <span ng_bind="name"></span> <br/>
      <span data-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
      <span x-ng-bind="name"></span> <br/>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsBindExample', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (April 23, 1858 – October 4, 1947)';
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should show off bindings', function() {
      var containerElm = element(by.css('div[ng-controller="Controller"]'));
      var nameBindings = containerElm.all(by.binding('name'));

      expect(nameBindings.count()).toBe(5);
      nameBindings.each(function(elem) {
        expect(elem.getText()).toEqual('Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (April 23, 1858 – October 4, 1947)');
      });
    });
  </file>
</example>

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Prefer using the dash-delimited format (e.g. `ng-bind` for `ngBind`).
If you want to use an HTML validating tool, you can instead use the `data`-prefixed version (e.g.
`data-ng-bind` for `ngBind`).
The other forms shown above are accepted for legacy reasons but we advise you to avoid them.
</div>

### Directive types

`$compile` can match directives based on element names (E), attributes (A), class names (C),
and comments (M).

The built-in AngularJS directives show in their documentation page which type of matching they support.

The following demonstrates the various ways a directive (`myDir` in this case) that matches all
4 types can be referenced from within a template.

```html
<my-dir></my-dir>
<span my-dir="exp"></span>
<!-- directive: my-dir exp -->
<span class="my-dir: exp;"></span>
```

A directive can specify which of the 4 matching types it supports in the
{@link ng.$compile#-restrict- `restrict`} property of the directive definition object.
The default is `EA`.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Prefer using directives via tag name and attributes over comment and class names.
Doing so generally makes it easier to determine what directives a given element matches.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Comment directives were commonly used in places where the DOM API limits the
ability to create directives that spanned multiple elements (e.g. inside `<table>` elements).
AngularJS 1.2 introduces {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ng-repeat-start` and `ng-repeat-end`}
as a better solution to this problem. Developers are encouraged to use this over custom comment
directives when possible.
</div>


## Creating Directives

First let's talk about the {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive API for registering directives}. Much like
controllers, directives are registered on modules. To register a directive, you use the
`module.directive` API. `module.directive` takes the
{@link guide/directive#matching-directives normalized} directive name
followed by a **factory function.** This factory function should return an object with the different
options to tell `$compile` how the directive should behave when matched.


The factory function is invoked only once when the
{@link ng.$compile compiler} matches the directive for the first time. You can perform any
initialization work here. The function is invoked using
{@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke} which makes it injectable just like a
controller.


We'll go over a few common examples of directives, then dive deep into the different options
and compilation process.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** In order to avoid collisions with some future standard, it's best to prefix your own
directive names. For instance, if you created a `<carousel>` directive, it would be problematic if HTML7
introduced the same element. A two or three letter prefix (e.g. `btfCarousel`) works well. Similarly, do
not prefix your own directives with `ng` or they might conflict with directives included in a future
version of AngularJS.
</div>

For the following examples, we'll use the prefix `my` (e.g. `myCustomer`).


### Template-expanding directive

Let's say you have a chunk of your template that represents a customer's information. This template
is repeated many times in your code. When you change it in one place, you have to change it in
several others. This is a good opportunity to use a directive to simplify your template.

Let's create a directive that simply replaces its contents with a static template:

<example module="docsSimpleDirective" name="directive-simple">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsSimpleDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Naomi',
          address: '1600 Amphitheatre'
        };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          template: 'Name: {{customer.name}} Address: {{customer.address}}'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <div my-customer></div>
    </div>
  </file>
</example>

Notice that we have bindings in this directive. After `$compile` compiles and links
`<div my-customer></div>`, it will try to match directives on the element's children. This means you
can compose directives of other directives. We'll see how to do that in
{@link guide/directive#creating-directives-that-communicate an example}
below.

In the example above we in-lined the value of the `template` option, but this will become annoying
as the size of your template grows.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Unless your template is very small, it's typically better to break it apart into
its own HTML file and load it with the `templateUrl` option.
</div>

If you are familiar with `ngInclude`, `templateUrl` works just like it. Here's the same example
using `templateUrl` instead:

<example module="docsTemplateUrlDirective" name="directive-template-url">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTemplateUrlDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Naomi',
          address: '1600 Amphitheatre'
        };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          templateUrl: 'my-customer.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <div my-customer></div>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-customer.html">
    Name: {{customer.name}} Address: {{customer.address}}
  </file>
</example>

`templateUrl` can also be a function which returns the URL of an HTML template to be loaded and
used for the directive. AngularJS will call the `templateUrl` function with two parameters: the
element that the directive was called on, and an `attr` object associated with that element.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** You do not currently have the ability to access scope variables from the `templateUrl`
function, since the template is requested before the scope is initialized.
</div>

<example module="docsTemplateUrlDirective" name="directive-template-url-fn">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTemplateUrlDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Naomi',
          address: '1600 Amphitheatre'
        };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          templateUrl: function(elem, attr) {
            return 'customer-' + attr.type + '.html';
          }
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <div my-customer type="name"></div>
      <div my-customer type="address"></div>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="customer-name.html">
    Name: {{customer.name}}
  </file>
  <file name="customer-address.html">
    Address: {{customer.address}}
  </file>
</example>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** When you create a directive, it is restricted to attribute and elements only by default. In order to
create directives that are triggered by class name, you need to use the `restrict` option.
</div>

The `restrict` option is typically set to:

* `'A'` - only matches attribute name
* `'E'` - only matches element name
* `'C'` - only matches class name
* `'M'` - only matches comment

These restrictions can all be combined as needed:

* `'AEC'` - matches either attribute or element or class name

Let's change our directive to use `restrict: 'E'`:

<example module="docsRestrictDirective" name="directive-restrict">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsRestrictDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Naomi',
          address: '1600 Amphitheatre'
        };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          templateUrl: 'my-customer.html'
        };
      });
  </file>

  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <my-customer></my-customer>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="my-customer.html">
    Name: {{customer.name}} Address: {{customer.address}}
  </file>
</example>

For more on the `restrict` property, see the
{@link ng.$compile#directive-definition-object API docs}.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**When should I use an attribute versus an element?**

Use an element when you are creating a component that is in control of the template. The common case
for this is when you are creating a Domain-Specific Language for parts of your template.

Use an attribute when you are decorating an existing element with new functionality.
</div>

Using an element for the `myCustomer` directive is clearly the right choice because you're not
decorating an element with some "customer" behavior; you're defining the core behavior of the
element as a customer component.



### Isolating the Scope of a Directive

Our `myCustomer` directive above is great, but it has a fatal flaw. We can only use it once within a
given scope.

In its current implementation, we'd need to create a different controller each time in order to
re-use such a directive:

<example module="docsScopeProblemExample" name="directive-scope-problem">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsScopeProblemExample', [])
      .controller('NaomiController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Naomi',
          address: '1600 Amphitheatre'
        };
      }])
      .controller('IgorController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.customer = {
          name: 'Igor',
          address: '123 Somewhere'
        };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          templateUrl: 'my-customer.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="NaomiController">
      <my-customer></my-customer>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div ng-controller="IgorController">
      <my-customer></my-customer>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-customer.html">
    Name: {{customer.name}} Address: {{customer.address}}
  </file>
</example>

This is clearly not a great solution.

What we want to be able to do is separate the scope inside a directive from the scope
outside, and then map the outer scope to a directive's inner scope. We can do this by creating what
we call an **isolate scope**. To do this, we can use a {@link $compile#-scope- directive's `scope`} option:

<example module="docsIsolateScopeDirective" name="directive-isolate">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsIsolateScopeDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.naomi = { name: 'Naomi', address: '1600 Amphitheatre' };
        $scope.igor = { name: 'Igor', address: '123 Somewhere' };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          scope: {
            customerInfo: '=info'
          },
          templateUrl: 'my-customer-iso.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <my-customer info="naomi"></my-customer>
      <hr>
      <my-customer info="igor"></my-customer>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-customer-iso.html">
    Name: {{customerInfo.name}} Address: {{customerInfo.address}}
  </file>
</example>

Looking at `index.html`, the first `<my-customer>` element binds the `info` attribute to `naomi`,
which we have exposed on our controller's scope. The second binds `info` to `igor`.

Let's take a closer look at the scope option:

```javascript
//...
scope: {
  customerInfo: '=info'
},
//...
```

The **scope option** is an object that contains a property for each isolate scope binding.  In this
case it has just one property:

- Its name (`customerInfo`) corresponds to the directive's **isolate scope** property,
  `customerInfo`.
- Its value (`=info`) tells `$compile` to bind to the `info` attribute.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** These `=attr` attributes in the `scope` option of directives are normalized just like
directive names. To bind to the attribute in `<div bind-to-this="thing">`, you'd specify a binding
of `=bindToThis`.
</div>

For cases where the attribute name is the same as the value you want to bind to inside the
directive's scope, you can use this shorthand syntax:

```javascript
...
scope: {
  // same as '=customer'
  customer: '='
},
...
```

Besides making it possible to bind different data to the scope inside a directive, using an isolated
scope has another effect.

We can show this by adding another property, `vojta`, to our scope and trying to access it from
within our directive's template:

<example module="docsIsolationExample" name="directive-isolate-2">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsIsolationExample', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.naomi = { name: 'Naomi', address: '1600 Amphitheatre' };
        $scope.vojta = { name: 'Vojta', address: '3456 Somewhere Else' };
      }])
      .directive('myCustomer', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          scope: {
            customerInfo: '=info'
          },
          templateUrl: 'my-customer-plus-vojta.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <my-customer info="naomi"></my-customer>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-customer-plus-vojta.html">
    Name: {{customerInfo.name}} Address: {{customerInfo.address}}
    <hr>
    Name: {{vojta.name}} Address: {{vojta.address}}
  </file>
</example>

Notice that `{{vojta.name}}` and `{{vojta.address}}` are empty, meaning they are undefined.
Although we defined `vojta` in the controller, it's not available within the directive.

As the name suggests, the **isolate scope** of the directive isolates everything except models that
you've explicitly added to the `scope: {}` hash object. This is helpful when building reusable
components because it prevents a component from changing your model state except for the models
that you explicitly pass in.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** Normally, a scope prototypically inherits from its parent. An isolated scope does not.
See the {@link $compile#directive-definition-object "Directive Definition Object - scope"} section
for more information about isolate scopes.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Use the `scope` option to create isolate scopes when making components that you
want to reuse throughout your app.
</div>


### Creating a Directive that Manipulates the DOM

In this example we will build a directive that displays the current time.
Once a second, it updates the DOM to reflect the current time.

Directives that want to modify the DOM typically use the `link` option to register DOM listeners
as well as update the DOM. It is executed after the template has been cloned and is where
directive logic will be put.

 `link` takes a function with the following signature,
`function link(scope, element, attrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }`, where:

* `scope` is an AngularJS scope object.
* `element` is the jqLite-wrapped element that this directive matches.
* `attrs` is a hash object with key-value pairs of normalized attribute names and their
  corresponding attribute values.
* `controller` is the directive's required controller instance(s) or its own controller (if any).
  The exact value depends on the directive's require property.
* `transcludeFn` is a transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.

<div class="alert alert-info">
For more details on the `link` option refer to the {@link ng.$compile#-link- `$compile` API} page.
</div>

In our `link` function, we want to update the displayed time once a second, or whenever a user
changes the time formatting string that our directive binds to. We will use the `$interval` service
to call a handler on a regular basis. This is easier than using `$timeout` but also works better with
end-to-end testing, where we want to ensure that all `$timeout`s have completed before completing the test.
We also want to remove the `$interval` if the directive is deleted so we don't introduce a memory leak.

<example module="docsTimeDirective" name="directive-link">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTimeDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.format = 'M/d/yy h:mm:ss a';
      }])
      .directive('myCurrentTime', ['$interval', 'dateFilter', function($interval, dateFilter) {

        function link(scope, element, attrs) {
          var format,
              timeoutId;

          function updateTime() {
            element.text(dateFilter(new Date(), format));
          }

          scope.$watch(attrs.myCurrentTime, function(value) {
            format = value;
            updateTime();
          });

          element.on('$destroy', function() {
            $interval.cancel(timeoutId);
          });

          // start the UI update process; save the timeoutId for canceling
          timeoutId = $interval(function() {
            updateTime(); // update DOM
          }, 1000);
        }

        return {
          link: link
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      Date format: <input ng-model="format"> <hr/>
      Current time is: <span my-current-time="format"></span>
    </div>
  </file>
</example>

There are a couple of things to note here.
Just like the `module.controller` API, the function argument in `module.directive` is dependency
injected. Because of this, we can use `$interval` and `dateFilter` inside our directive's `link`
function.

We register an event `element.on('$destroy', ...)`. What fires this `$destroy` event?

There are a few special events that AngularJS emits. When a DOM node that has been compiled
with AngularJS's compiler is destroyed, it emits a `$destroy` event. Similarly, when an AngularJS
scope is destroyed, it broadcasts a `$destroy` event to listening scopes.

By listening to this event, you can remove event listeners that might cause memory leaks.
Listeners registered to scopes and elements are automatically cleaned up when they are destroyed,
but if you registered a listener on a service, or registered a listener on a DOM node that isn't
being deleted, you'll have to clean it up yourself or you risk introducing a memory leak.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** Directives should clean up after themselves. You can use
`element.on('$destroy', ...)` or `scope.$on('$destroy', ...)` to run a clean-up function when the
directive is removed.
</div>


### Creating a Directive that Wraps Other Elements

We've seen that you can pass in models to a directive using the isolate scope, but sometimes
it's desirable to be able to pass in an entire template rather than a string or an object.
Let's say that we want to create a "dialog box" component. The dialog box should be able to
wrap any arbitrary content.

To do this, we need to use the `transclude` option.

<example module="docsTransclusionDirective" name="directive-transclude">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTransclusionDirective', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Tobias';
      }])
      .directive('myDialog', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          transclude: true,
          scope: {},
          templateUrl: 'my-dialog.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <my-dialog>Check out the contents, {{name}}!</my-dialog>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-dialog.html">
    <div class="alert" ng-transclude></div>
  </file>
</example>

What does this `transclude` option do, exactly? `transclude` makes the contents of a directive with
this option have access to the scope **outside** of the directive rather than inside.

To illustrate this, see the example below. Notice that we've added a `link` function in `script.js`
that redefines `name` as `Jeff`. What do you think the `{{name}}` binding will resolve to now?

<example module="docsTransclusionExample" name="directive-transclusion">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTransclusionExample', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.name = 'Tobias';
      }])
      .directive('myDialog', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          transclude: true,
          scope: {},
          templateUrl: 'my-dialog.html',
          link: function(scope) {
            scope.name = 'Jeff';
          }
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      <my-dialog>Check out the contents, {{name}}!</my-dialog>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-dialog.html">
    <div class="alert" ng-transclude></div>
  </file>
</example>

Ordinarily, we would expect that `{{name}}` would be `Jeff`. However, we see in this example that
the `{{name}}` binding is still `Tobias`.

The `transclude` option changes the way scopes are nested. It makes it so that the **contents** of a
transcluded directive have whatever scope is outside the directive, rather than whatever scope is on
the inside. In doing so, it gives the contents access to the outside scope.

Note that if the directive did not create its own scope, then `scope` in `scope.name = 'Jeff'` would
reference the outside scope and we would see `Jeff` in the output.

This behavior makes sense for a directive that wraps some content, because otherwise you'd have to
pass in each model you wanted to use separately. If you have to pass in each model that you want to
use, then you can't really have arbitrary contents, can you?

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** only use `transclude: true` when you want to create a directive that wraps
arbitrary content.
</div>

Next, we want to add buttons to this dialog box, and allow someone using the directive to bind their
own behavior to it.

<example module="docsIsoFnBindExample" name="directive-transclusion-scope">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsIsoFnBindExample', [])
      .controller('Controller', ['$scope', '$timeout', function($scope, $timeout) {
        $scope.name = 'Tobias';
        $scope.message = '';
        $scope.hideDialog = function(message) {
          $scope.message = message;
          $scope.dialogIsHidden = true;
          $timeout(function() {
            $scope.message = '';
            $scope.dialogIsHidden = false;
          }, 2000);
        };
      }])
      .directive('myDialog', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          transclude: true,
          scope: {
            'close': '&onClose'
          },
          templateUrl: 'my-dialog-close.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="Controller">
      {{message}}
      <my-dialog ng-hide="dialogIsHidden" on-close="hideDialog(message)">
        Check out the contents, {{name}}!
      </my-dialog>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-dialog-close.html">
    <div class="alert">
      <a href class="close" ng-click="close({message: 'closing for now'})">&times;</a>
      <div ng-transclude></div>
    </div>
  </file>
</example>

We want to run the function we pass by invoking it from the directive's scope, but have it run
in the context of the scope where it's registered.

We saw earlier how to use `=attr` in the `scope` option, but in the above example, we're using
`&attr` instead.  The `&` binding allows a directive to trigger evaluation of an expression in
the context of the original scope, at a specific time.  Any legal expression is allowed, including
an expression which contains a function call.  Because of this, `&` bindings are ideal for binding
callback functions to directive behaviors.

When the user clicks the `x` in the dialog, the directive's `close` function is called, thanks to
`ng-click.`  This call to `close` on the isolated scope actually evaluates the expression
`hideDialog(message)` in the context of the original scope, thus running `Controller`'s `hideDialog`
function.

Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolate scope via an expression to the
parent scope, this can be done by passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression
wrapper function. For example, the `hideDialog` function takes a message to display when the dialog
is hidden. This is specified in the directive by calling `close({message: 'closing for now'})`.
Then the local variable `message` will be available within the `on-close` expression.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** use `&attr` in the `scope` option when you want your directive
to expose an API for binding to behaviors.
</div>


### Creating a Directive that Adds Event Listeners

Previously, we used the `link` function to create a directive that manipulated its
DOM elements. Building upon that example, let's make a directive that reacts to events on
its elements.

For instance, what if we wanted to create a directive that lets a user drag an
element?

<example module="dragModule" name="directive-drag">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('dragModule', [])
      .directive('myDraggable', ['$document', function($document) {
        return {
          link: function(scope, element, attr) {
            var startX = 0, startY = 0, x = 0, y = 0;

            element.css({
             position: 'relative',
             border: '1px solid red',
             backgroundColor: 'lightgrey',
             cursor: 'pointer'
            });

            element.on('mousedown', function(event) {
              // Prevent default dragging of selected content
              event.preventDefault();
              startX = event.pageX - x;
              startY = event.pageY - y;
              $document.on('mousemove', mousemove);
              $document.on('mouseup', mouseup);
            });

            function mousemove(event) {
              y = event.pageY - startY;
              x = event.pageX - startX;
              element.css({
                top: y + 'px',
                left:  x + 'px'
              });
            }

            function mouseup() {
              $document.off('mousemove', mousemove);
              $document.off('mouseup', mouseup);
            }
          }
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <span my-draggable>Drag Me</span>
  </file>
</example>



### Creating Directives that Communicate

You can compose any directives by using them within templates.

Sometimes, you want a component that's built from a combination of directives.

Imagine you want to have a container with tabs in which the contents of the container correspond
to which tab is active.

<example module="docsTabsExample" name="directive-tabs">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('docsTabsExample', [])
      .directive('myTabs', function() {
        return {
          restrict: 'E',
          transclude: true,
          scope: {},
          controller: ['$scope', function MyTabsController($scope) {
            var panes = $scope.panes = [];

            $scope.select = function(pane) {
              angular.forEach(panes, function(pane) {
                pane.selected = false;
              });
              pane.selected = true;
            };

            this.addPane = function(pane) {
              if (panes.length === 0) {
                $scope.select(pane);
              }
              panes.push(pane);
            };
          }],
          templateUrl: 'my-tabs.html'
        };
      })
      .directive('myPane', function() {
        return {
          require: '^^myTabs',
          restrict: 'E',
          transclude: true,
          scope: {
            title: '@'
          },
          link: function(scope, element, attrs, tabsCtrl) {
            tabsCtrl.addPane(scope);
          },
          templateUrl: 'my-pane.html'
        };
      });
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <my-tabs>
      <my-pane title="Hello">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
      </my-pane>
      <my-pane title="World">
        <em>Mauris elementum elementum enim at suscipit.</em>
        <p><a href ng-click="i = i + 1">counter: {{i || 0}}</a></p>
      </my-pane>
    </my-tabs>
  </file>
  <file name="my-tabs.html">
    <div class="tabbable">
      <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        <li ng-repeat="pane in panes" ng-class="{active:pane.selected}">
          <a href="" ng-click="select(pane)">{{pane.title}}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="tab-content" ng-transclude></div>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="my-pane.html">
    <div class="tab-pane" ng-show="selected">
      <h4>{{title}}</h4>
      <div ng-transclude></div>
    </div>
  </file>
</example>

The `myPane` directive has a `require` option with value `^^myTabs`. When a directive uses this
option, `$compile` will throw an error unless the specified controller is found. The `^^` prefix
means that this directive searches for the controller on its parents. (A `^` prefix would make the
directive look for the controller on its own element or its parents; without any prefix, the
directive would look on its own element only.)

So where does this `myTabs` controller come from? Directives can specify controllers using
the unsurprisingly named `controller` option. As you can see, the `myTabs` directive uses this
option. Just like `ngController`, this option attaches a controller to the template of the directive.

If it is necessary to reference the controller or any functions bound to the controller from the
template, you can use the option `controllerAs` to specify the name of the controller as an alias.
The directive needs to define a scope for this configuration to be used. This is particularly useful
in the case when the directive is used as a component.

Looking back at `myPane`'s definition, notice the last argument in its `link` function: `tabsCtrl`.
When a directive requires a controller, it receives that controller as the fourth argument of its
`link` function. Taking advantage of this, `myPane` can call the `addPane` function of `myTabs`.

If multiple controllers are required, the `require` option of the directive can take an array argument.
The corresponding parameter being sent to the `link` function will also be an array.

```js
angular.module('docsTabsExample', [])
  .directive('myPane', function() {
    return {
      require: ['^^myTabs', 'ngModel'],
      restrict: 'E',
      transclude: true,
      scope: {
        title: '@'
      },
      link: function(scope, element, attrs, controllers) {
        var tabsCtrl = controllers[0],
            modelCtrl = controllers[1];

        tabsCtrl.addPane(scope);
      },
      templateUrl: 'my-pane.html'
    };
  });
```

Savvy readers may be wondering what the difference is between `link` and `controller`.
The basic difference is that `controller` can expose an API, and `link` functions can interact with
controllers using `require`.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** use `controller` when you want to expose an API to other directives.
Otherwise use `link`.
</div>

## Summary

Here we've seen the main use cases for directives. Each of these samples acts as a good starting
point for creating your own directives.

# E2E Testing

As applications grow in size and complexity, it becomes unrealistic to rely on manual testing to
verify the correctness of new features, catch bugs and notice regressions. Unit tests
are the first line of defense for catching bugs, but sometimes issues come up with integration
between components which can't be captured in a unit test. End-to-end tests are made to find
these problems.

We have built [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor), an end
to end test runner which simulates user interactions that will help you verify the health of your
AngularJS application.

## Using Protractor

Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) program, and runs end-to-end tests that are also
written in JavaScript and run with node. Protractor uses [WebDriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingStarted)
to control browsers and simulate user actions.

For more information on Protractor, view [getting started](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/getting-started)
or the [api docs](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api).

Protractor uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) for its test syntax.
As in unit testing, a test file is comprised of one or
more `it` blocks that describe the requirements of your application. `it` blocks are made of
**commands** and **expectations**. Commands tell Protractor to do something with the application
such as navigate to a page or click on a button. Expectations tell Protractor to assert something
about the application's state, such as the value of a field or the current URL.

If any expectation within an `it` block fails, the runner marks the `it` as "failed" and continues
on to the next block.

Test files may also have `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks, which will be run before or after
each `it` block regardless of whether the block passes or fails.

<img src="img/guide/scenario_runner.png">

In addition to the above elements, tests may also contain helper functions to avoid duplicating
code in the `it` blocks.

Here is an example of a simple test:
```js
describe('TODO list', function() {
  it('should filter results', function() {

    // Find the element with ng-model="user" and type "jacksparrow" into it
    element(by.model('user')).sendKeys('jacksparrow');

    // Find the first (and only) button on the page and click it
    element(by.css(':button')).click();

    // Verify that there are 10 tasks
    expect(element.all(by.repeater('task in tasks')).count()).toEqual(10);

    // Enter 'groceries' into the element with ng-model="filterText"
    element(by.model('filterText')).sendKeys('groceries');

    // Verify that now there is only one item in the task list
    expect(element.all(by.repeater('task in tasks')).count()).toEqual(1);
  });
});
```

This test describes the requirements of a ToDo list, specifically, that it should be able to
filter the list of items.

## Example
See the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project for more examples, or look
at the embedded examples in the AngularJS documentation (For example, {@link $http $http}
has an end-to-end test in the example under the `protractor.js` tag).

## Caveats

Protractor does not work out-of-the-box with apps that bootstrap manually using
`angular.bootstrap`. You must use the `ng-app` directive.

@name  Expressions
@sortOrder 270
@description

# AngularJS Expressions

AngularJS expressions are JavaScript-like code snippets that are mainly placed in
interpolation bindings such as `<span title="{{ attrBinding }}">{{ textBinding }}</span>`,
but also used directly in directive attributes such as `ng-click="functionExpression()"`.

For example, these are valid expressions in AngularJS:

  * `1+2`
  * `a+b`
  * `user.name`
  * `items[index]`


## AngularJS Expressions vs. JavaScript Expressions

AngularJS expressions are like JavaScript expressions with the following differences:

  * **Context:** JavaScript expressions are evaluated against the global `window`.
    In AngularJS, expressions are evaluated against a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope `scope`} object.

  * **Forgiving:** In JavaScript, trying to evaluate undefined properties generates `ReferenceError`
    or `TypeError`. In AngularJS, expression evaluation is forgiving to `undefined` and `null`.

  * **Filters:** You can use {@link guide/filter filters} within expressions to format data before
    displaying it.

  * **No Control Flow Statements:** You cannot use the following in an AngularJS expression:
    conditionals, loops, or exceptions.

  * **No Function Declarations:** You cannot declare functions in an AngularJS expression,
    even inside `ng-init` directive.

  * **No RegExp Creation With Literal Notation:** You cannot create regular expressions
    in an AngularJS expression. An exception to this rule is {@link ngPattern `ng-pattern`} which accepts valid
    RegExp.

  * **No Object Creation With New Operator:** You cannot use `new` operator in an AngularJS expression.

  * **No Bitwise, Comma, And Void Operators:** You cannot use
  [Bitwise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators),
  `,` or `void` operators in an AngularJS expression.


If you want to run more complex JavaScript code, you should make it a controller method and call
the method from your view. If you want to `eval()` an AngularJS expression yourself, use the
{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$eval `$eval()`} method.

## Example
<example name="expression-simple">
  <file name="index.html">
    <span>
      1+2={{1+2}}
    </span>
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should calculate expression in binding', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding('1+2')).getText()).toEqual('1+2=3');
    });
  </file>
</example>

You can try evaluating different expressions here:

<example module="expressionExample" name="expression-eval">
  <file name="index.html">

        $scope.addExp = function(expr) {
          exprs.push(expr);
        };

        $scope.removeExp = function(index) {
          exprs.splice(index, 1);
        };
      }]);

## Context

AngularJS does not use JavaScript's `eval()` to evaluate expressions. Instead AngularJS's
{@link ng.$parse $parse} service processes these expressions.

AngularJS expressions do not have direct access to global variables like `window`, `document` or `location`.
This restriction is intentional. It prevents accidental access to the global state – a common source of subtle bugs.

Instead use services like `$window` and `$location` in functions on controllers, which are then called from expressions.
Such services provide mockable access to globals.

It is possible to access the context object using the identifier `this` and the locals object using the
identifier `$locals`.

<example module="expressionExample" name="expression-locals">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div class="example2" ng-controller="ExampleController">
      Name: <input ng-model="name" type="text"/>
      <button ng-click="greet()">Greet</button>
      <button ng-click="window.alert('Should not see me')">Won't greet</button>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('expressionExample', [])
      .controller('ExampleController', ['$window', '$scope', function($window, $scope) {
        $scope.name = 'World';

        $scope.greet = function() {
          $window.alert('Hello ' + $scope.name);
        };
      }]);
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should calculate expression in binding', function() {
      if (browser.params.browser === 'safari') {
        // Safari can't handle dialogs.
        return;
      }
      element(by.css('[ng-click="greet()"]')).click();

      // We need to give the browser time to display the alert
      browser.wait(protractor.ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent(), 1000);

      var alertDialog = browser.switchTo().alert();

      expect(alertDialog.getText()).toEqual('Hello World');

      alertDialog.accept();
    });
  </file>
</example>

## Forgiving

Expression evaluation is forgiving to undefined and null. In JavaScript, evaluating `a.b.c` throws
an exception if `a` is not an object. While this makes sense for a general purpose language, the
expression evaluations are primarily used for data binding, which often look like this:

        {{a.b.c}}

It makes more sense to show nothing than to throw an exception if `a` is undefined (perhaps we are
waiting for the server response, and it will become defined soon). If expression evaluation wasn't
forgiving we'd have to write bindings that clutter the code, for example: `{{((a||{}).b||{}).c}}`

Similarly, invoking a function `a.b.c()` on `undefined` or `null` simply returns `undefined`.


## No Control Flow Statements

Apart from the ternary operator (`a ? b : c`), you cannot write a control flow statement in an
expression. The reason behind this is core to the AngularJS philosophy that application logic should
be in controllers, not the views. If you need a real conditional, loop, or to throw from a view
expression, delegate to a JavaScript method instead.

## No function declarations or RegExp creation with literal notation

You can't declare functions or create regular expressions from within AngularJS expressions. This is
to avoid complex model transformation logic inside templates. Such logic is better placed in a
controller or in a dedicated filter where it can be tested properly.

## `$event`

Directives like {@link ng.directive:ngClick `ngClick`} and {@link ng.directive:ngFocus `ngFocus`}
expose a `$event` object within the scope of that expression. The object is an instance of a [jQuery
Event Object](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/) when jQuery is present or a
similar jqLite object.

<example module="eventExampleApp" name="expression-events">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="EventController">
      <button ng-click="clickMe($event)">Event</button>
      <p><code>$event</code>: <pre> {{$event | json}}</pre></p>
      <p><code>clickEvent</code>: <pre>{{clickEvent | json}}</pre></p>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('eventExampleApp', []).
      controller('EventController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        /*
         * expose the event object to the scope
         */
        $scope.clickMe = function(clickEvent) {
          $scope.clickEvent = simpleKeys(clickEvent);
          console.log(clickEvent);
        };

        /*
         * return a copy of an object with only non-object keys
         * we need this to avoid circular references
         */
        function simpleKeys(original) {
          return Object.keys(original).reduce(function(obj, key) {
            obj[key] = typeof original[key] === 'object' ? '{ ... }' : original[key];
            return obj;
          }, {});
        }
      }]);
  </file>
</example>

Note in the example above how we can pass in `$event` to `clickMe`, but how it does not show up
in `{{$event}}`. This is because `$event` is outside the scope of that binding.


## One-time binding

An expression that starts with `::` is considered a one-time expression. One-time expressions
will stop recalculating once they are stable, which happens after the first digest if the expression
result is a non-undefined value (see value stabilization algorithm below).

<example module="oneTimeBindingExampleApp" name="expression-one-time">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="EventController">
      <button ng-click="clickMe($event)">Click Me</button>
      <p id="one-time-binding-example">One time binding: {{::name}}</p>
      <p id="normal-binding-example">Normal binding: {{name}}</p>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('oneTimeBindingExampleApp', []).
      controller('EventController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        var counter = 0;
        var names = ['Igor', 'Misko', 'Chirayu', 'Lucas'];
        /*
         * expose the event object to the scope
         */
        $scope.clickMe = function(clickEvent) {
          $scope.name = names[counter % names.length];
          counter++;
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should freeze binding after its value has stabilized', function() {
      var oneTimeBinding = element(by.id('one-time-binding-example'));
      var normalBinding = element(by.id('normal-binding-example'));

      expect(oneTimeBinding.getText()).toEqual('One time binding:');
      expect(normalBinding.getText()).toEqual('Normal binding:');
      element(by.buttonText('Click Me')).click();

      expect(oneTimeBinding.getText()).toEqual('One time binding: Igor');
      expect(normalBinding.getText()).toEqual('Normal binding: Igor');
      element(by.buttonText('Click Me')).click();

      expect(oneTimeBinding.getText()).toEqual('One time binding: Igor');
      expect(normalBinding.getText()).toEqual('Normal binding: Misko');

      element(by.buttonText('Click Me')).click();
      element(by.buttonText('Click Me')).click();

      expect(oneTimeBinding.getText()).toEqual('One time binding: Igor');
      expect(normalBinding.getText()).toEqual('Normal binding: Lucas');
    });
  </file>
</example>


### Reasons for using one-time binding

The main purpose of one-time binding expression is to provide a way to create a binding
that gets deregistered and frees up resources once the binding is stabilized.
Reducing the number of expressions being watched makes the digest loop faster and allows more
information to be displayed at the same time.


### Value stabilization algorithm

One-time binding expressions will retain the value of the expression at the end of the
digest cycle as long as that value is not undefined. If the value of the expression is set
within the digest loop and later, within the same digest loop, it is set to undefined,
then the expression is not fulfilled and will remain watched.

  1. Given an expression that starts with `::`, when a digest loop is entered and expression
     is dirty-checked, store the value as V
  2. If V is not undefined, mark the result of the expression as stable and schedule a task
     to deregister the watch for this expression when we exit the digest loop
  3. Process the digest loop as normal
  4. When digest loop is done and all the values have settled, process the queue of watch
     deregistration tasks. For each watch to be deregistered, check if it still evaluates
     to a value that is not `undefined`. If that's the case, deregister the watch. Otherwise,
     keep dirty-checking the watch in the future digest loops by following the same
     algorithm starting from step 1

#### Special case for object literals

Unlike simple values, object-literals are watched until every key is defined.
See http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2760-one-time-data-bindings-for-object-literal-expressions-in-angularjs-1-3.htm

### How to benefit from one-time binding

If the expression will not change once set, it is a candidate for one-time binding.
Here are three example cases.

When interpolating text or attributes:

```html
  <div name="attr: {{::color}}">text: {{::name | uppercase}}</div>
```

When using a directive with bidirectional binding and parameters that will not change:

```js
someModule.directive('someDirective', function() {
  return {
    scope: {
      name: '=',
      color: '@'
    },
    template: '{{name}}: {{color}}'
  };
});
```

```html
  <div some-directive name="::myName" color="My color is {{::myColor}}"></div>
```


When using a directive that takes an expression:

```html
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="item in ::items | orderBy:'name'">{{item.name}};</li>
</ul>
```

## guide/filter.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name Filters
@sortOrder 280
@description

# Filters

Filters format the value of an expression for display to the user. They can be used in view
templates, controllers or services. AngularJS comes with a collection of
[built-in filters](api/ng/filter), but it is easy to define your own as well.

The underlying API is the {@link ng.$filterProvider}.

## Using filters in view templates

Filters can be applied to expressions in view templates using the following syntax:

        {{ expression | filter }}

E.g. the markup `{{ 12 | currency }}` formats the number 12 as a currency using the {@link ng.filter:currency `currency`}
filter. The resulting value is `$12.00`.

Filters can be applied to the result of another filter. This is called "chaining" and uses
the following syntax:

        {{ expression | filter1 | filter2 | ... }}

Filters may have arguments. The syntax for this is

        {{ expression | filter:argument1:argument2:... }}

E.g. the markup `{{ 1234 | number:2 }}` formats the number 1234 with 2 decimal points using the
{@link ng.filter:number `number`} filter. The resulting value is `1,234.00`.

### When filters are executed

In templates, filters are only executed when their inputs have changed. This is more performant than executing
a filter on each {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest `$digest`} as is the case with {@link guide/expression expressions}.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

1. In general, this applies only to filters that take [primitive values](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Primitive)
as inputs. Filters that receive [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Objects)
as input are executed on each `$digest`, as it would be too costly to track if the inputs have changed.

2. Filters that are marked as `$stateful` are also executed on each $digest.
See {@link guide/filter#stateful-filters Stateful filters} for more information. Note that no AngularJS
core filters are $stateful.


## Using filters in controllers, services, and directives

You can also use filters in controllers, services, and directives.

<div class="alert alert-info">
For this, inject a dependency with the name `<filterName>Filter` into your controller/service/directive.
E.g. a filter called `number` is injected by using the dependency `numberFilter`. The injected argument
is a function that takes the value to format as first argument, and filter parameters starting with the second argument.
</div>

The example below uses the filter called {@link ng.filter:filter `filter`}.
This filter reduces arrays into sub arrays based on
conditions. The filter can be applied in the view template with markup like
`{{ctrl.array | filter:'a'}}`, which would do a fulltext search for "a".
However, using a filter in a view template will reevaluate the filter on
every digest, which can be costly if the array is big.

The example below therefore calls the filter directly in the controller.
By this, the controller is able to call the filter only when needed (e.g. when the data is loaded from the backend
or the filter expression is changed).

<example module="FilterInControllerModule" name="filter-in-controller">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="FilterController as ctrl">
      <div>
        All entries:
        <span ng-repeat="entry in ctrl.array">{{entry.name}} </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        Entries that contain an "a":
        <span ng-repeat="entry in ctrl.filteredArray">{{entry.name}} </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('FilterInControllerModule', []).
      controller('FilterController', ['filterFilter', function FilterController(filterFilter) {
        this.array = [
          {name: 'Tobias'},
          {name: 'Jeff'},
          {name: 'Brian'},
          {name: 'Igor'},
          {name: 'James'},
          {name: 'Brad'}
        ];
        this.filteredArray = filterFilter(this.array, 'a');
      }]);
  </file>
</example>


## Creating custom filters

Writing your own filter is very easy: just register a new filter factory function with
your module. Internally, this uses the {@link ng.$filterProvider `filterProvider`}.
This factory function should return a new filter function which takes the input value
as the first argument. Any filter arguments are passed in as additional arguments to the filter
function.

The filter function should be a [pure function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which
means that it should always return the same result given the same input arguments and should not affect
external state, for example, other AngularJS services. AngularJS relies on this contract and will by default
execute a filter only when the inputs to the function change.
{@link guide/filter#stateful-filters Stateful filters} are possible, but less performant.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** Filter names must be valid AngularJS {@link expression} identifiers, such as `uppercase` or `orderBy`.
Names with special characters, such as hyphens and dots, are not allowed.  If you wish to namespace
your filters, then you can use capitalization (`myappSubsectionFilterx`) or underscores
(`myapp_subsection_filterx`).
</div>

The following sample filter reverses a text string. In addition, it conditionally makes the
text upper-case.

<example module="myReverseFilterApp" name="filter-reverse">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="MyController">
      <input ng-model="greeting" type="text"><br>
      No filter: {{greeting}}<br>
      Reverse: {{greeting|reverse}}<br>
      Reverse + uppercase: {{greeting|reverse:true}}<br>
      Reverse, filtered in controller: {{filteredGreeting}}<br>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('myReverseFilterApp', [])
      .filter('reverse', function() {
        return function(input, uppercase) {
          input = input || '';
          var out = '';
          for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
            out = input.charAt(i) + out;
          }
          // conditional based on optional argument
          if (uppercase) {
            out = out.toUpperCase();
          }
          return out;
        };
      })
      .controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'reverseFilter', function($scope, reverseFilter) {
        $scope.greeting = 'hello';
        $scope.filteredGreeting = reverseFilter($scope.greeting);
      }]);
  </file>
</example>


### Stateful filters

It is strongly discouraged to write filters that are stateful, because the execution of those can't
be optimized by AngularJS, which often leads to performance issues. Many stateful filters can be
converted into stateless filters just by exposing the hidden state as a model and turning it into an
argument for the filter.

If you however do need to write a stateful filter, you have to mark the filter as `$stateful`, which
means that it will be executed one or more times during the each `$digest` cycle.

<example module="myStatefulFilterApp" name="filter-stateful">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="MyController">
      Input: <input ng-model="greeting" type="text"><br>
      Decoration: <input ng-model="decoration.symbol" type="text"><br>
      No filter: {{greeting}}<br>
      Decorated: {{greeting | decorate}}<br>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('myStatefulFilterApp', [])
      .filter('decorate', ['decoration', function(decoration) {

        function decorateFilter(input) {
          return decoration.symbol + input + decoration.symbol;
        }
        decorateFilter.$stateful = true;

        return decorateFilter;
      }])
      .controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'decoration', function($scope, decoration) {
        $scope.greeting = 'hello';
        $scope.decoration = decoration;
      }])
      .value('decoration', {symbol: '*'});
  </file>
</example>


## Testing custom filters

See the [phonecat tutorial](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_11#testing) for an example.

# Forms

Controls (`input`, `select`, `textarea`) are ways for a user to enter data.
A Form is a collection of controls for the purpose of grouping related controls together.

Form and controls provide validation services, so that the user can be notified of invalid input
before submitting a form. This provides a better user experience than server-side validation alone
because the user gets instant feedback on how to correct the error. Keep in mind that while
client-side validation plays an important role in providing good user experience, it can easily
be circumvented and thus can not be trusted. Server-side validation is still necessary for a
secure application.


## Simple form
The key directive in understanding two-way data-binding is {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel}.
The `ngModel` directive provides the two-way data-binding by synchronizing the model to the view,
as well as view to the model. In addition it provides an {@link ngModel.NgModelController API}
for other directives to augment its behavior.

<example module="formExample" name="forms-simple">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
      <form novalidate class="simple-form">
        <label>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="user.name" /></label><br />
        <label>E-mail: <input type="email" ng-model="user.email" /></label><br />
        Best Editor: <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.preference" value="vi" />vi</label>
        <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.preference" value="emacs" />emacs</label><br />
        <input type="button" ng-click="reset()" value="Reset" />
        <input type="submit" ng-click="update(user)" value="Save" />
      </form>
      <pre>user = {{user | json}}</pre>
      <pre>master = {{master | json}}</pre>
    </div>

    <script>
      angular.module('formExample', [])
        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
          $scope.master = {};

          $scope.update = function(user) {
            $scope.master = angular.copy(user);
          };

          $scope.reset = function() {
            $scope.user = angular.copy($scope.master);
          };

          $scope.reset();
        }]);
    </script>
  </file>
</example>


Note that `novalidate` is used to disable browser's native form validation.

The value of `ngModel` won't be set unless it passes validation for the input field.
For example: inputs of type `email` must have a value in the form of `user@domain`.



## Using CSS classes

To allow styling of form as well as controls, `ngModel`  adds these CSS classes:

- `ng-valid`: the model is valid
- `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
- `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
- `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
- `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
- `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
- `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
- `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
- `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled

The following example uses the CSS to display validity of each form control.
In the example both `user.name` and `user.email` are required, but are rendered
with red background only after the input is blurred (loses focus).
This ensures that the user is not distracted with an error until after interacting with the control,
and failing to satisfy its validity.

<example module="formExample" name="forms-css-classes">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
      <form novalidate class="css-form">
        <label>Name: <input type="text" ng-model="user.name" required /></label><br />
        <label>E-mail: <input type="email" ng-model="user.email" required /></label><br />
        Gender: <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.gender" value="male" />male</label>
        <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.gender" value="female" />female</label><br />
        <input type="button" ng-click="reset()" value="Reset" />
        <input type="submit" ng-click="update(user)" value="Save" />
      </form>
      <pre>user = {{user | json}}</pre>
      <pre>master = {{master | json}}</pre>
    </div>

    <style type="text/css">
      .css-form input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
        background-color: #FA787E;
      }

      .css-form input.ng-valid.ng-touched {
        background-color: #78FA89;
      }
    </style>

    <script>
      angular.module('formExample', [])
        .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
          $scope.master = {};

          $scope.update = function(user) {
            $scope.master = angular.copy(user);
          };

          $scope.reset = function() {
            $scope.user = angular.copy($scope.master);
          };

          $scope.reset();
        }]);
    </script>
  </file>
</example>



## Binding to form and control state

A form is an instance of {@link form.FormController FormController}.
The form instance can optionally be published into the scope using the `name` attribute.

Similarly, an input control that has the {@link ng.directive:ngModel ngModel} directive holds an
instance of {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController}. Such a control instance
can be published as a property of the form instance using the `name` attribute on the input control.
The name attribute specifies the name of the property on the form instance.

This implies that the internal state of both the form and the control is available for binding in
the view using the standard binding primitives.

This allows us to extend the above example with these features:

- Custom error message displayed after the user interacted with a control (i.e. when `$touched` is set)
- Custom error message displayed upon submitting the form (`$submitted` is set), even if the user
didn't interact with a control


<example module="formExample" name="forms-custom-error-messages">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
      <form name="form" class="css-form" novalidate>
        <label>Name:
          <input type="text" ng-model="user.name" name="uName" required="" />
        </label>
        <br />
        <div ng-show="form.$submitted || form.uName.$touched">
          <div ng-show="form.uName.$error.required">Tell us your name.</div>
        </div>

        <label>E-mail:
          <input type="email" ng-model="user.email" name="uEmail" required="" />
        </label>
        <br />
        <div ng-show="form.$submitted || form.uEmail.$touched">
          <span ng-show="form.uEmail.$error.required">Tell us your email.</span>
          <span ng-show="form.uEmail.$error.email">This is not a valid email.</span>
        </div>

        Gender:
        <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.gender" value="male" />male</label>
        <label><input type="radio" ng-model="user.gender" value="female" />female</label>
        <br />
        <label>
        <input type="checkbox" ng-model="user.agree" name="userAgree" required="" />

        I agree:
        </label>
        <input ng-show="user.agree" type="text" ng-model="user.agreeSign" required="" />
        <br />
        <div ng-show="form.$submitted || form.userAgree.$touched">
          <div ng-show="!user.agree || !user.agreeSign">Please agree and sign.</div>
        </div>

        <input type="button" ng-click="reset(form)" value="Reset" />
        <input type="submit" ng-click="update(user)" value="Save" />
      </form>
      <pre>user = {{user | json}}</pre>
      <pre>master = {{master | json}}</pre>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('formExample', [])
      .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.master = {};

        $scope.update = function(user) {
          $scope.master = angular.copy(user);
        };

        $scope.reset = function(form) {
          if (form) {
            form.$setPristine();
            form.$setUntouched();
          }
          $scope.user = angular.copy($scope.master);
        };

        $scope.reset();
      }]);
  </file>
</example>



## Custom model update triggers

By default, any change to the content will trigger a model update and form validation. You can
override this behavior using the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive to
bind only to specified list of events. I.e. `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }"` will update
and validate only after the control loses focus. You can set several events using a space delimited
list. I.e. `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'mousedown blur' }"`

<img alt="animation showing debounced input" src="img/guide/forms-update-on-blur.gif">

If you want to keep the default behavior and just add new events that may trigger the model update
and validation, add "default" as one of the specified events.

I.e. `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur' }"`

The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the form
will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event).

<example module="customTriggerExample" name="forms-custom-triggers">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
      <form>
        <label>Name:
          <input type="text" ng-model="user.name" ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }" /></label><br />
        <label>
        Other data:
        <input type="text" ng-model="user.data" /></label><br />
      </form>
      <pre>username = "{{user.name}}"</pre>
      <pre>userdata = "{{user.data}}"</pre>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="script.js">
     angular.module('customTriggerExample', [])
      .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.user = {};
      }]);
  </file>
</example>



## Non-immediate (debounced) model updates

You can delay the model update/validation by using the `debounce` key with the
{@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive. This delay will also apply to
parsers, validators and model flags like `$dirty` or `$pristine`.

<img alt="animation showing debounced input" src="img/guide/forms-debounce.gif">

I.e. `ng-model-options="{ debounce: 500 }"` will wait for half a second since
the last content change before triggering the model update and form validation.

If custom triggers are used, custom debouncing timeouts can be set for each event using an object
in `debounce`. This can be useful to force immediate updates on some specific circumstances
(like blur events).

I.e. `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { default: 500, blur: 0 } }"`

If those attributes are added to an element, they will be applied to all the child elements and
controls that inherit from it unless they are overridden.

This example shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 250 milliseconds
after last change.

<example module="debounceExample" name="forms-debounce">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
      <form>
        <label>Name:
        <input type="text" ng-model="user.name" ng-model-options="{ debounce: 250 }" /></label><br />
      </form>
      <pre>username = "{{user.name}}"</pre>
    </div>
  </file>
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('debounceExample', [])
      .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.user = {};
      }]);
  </file>
</example>

## Custom Validation

AngularJS provides basic implementation for most common HTML5 {@link ng.directive:input input}
types: ({@link input[text] text}, {@link input[number] number}, {@link input[url] url},
{@link input[email] email}, {@link input[date] date}, {@link input[radio] radio}, {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}),
as well as some directives for validation (`required`, `pattern`, `minlength`, `maxlength`,
`min`, `max`).

With a custom directive, you can add your own validation functions to the `$validators` object on
the {@link ngModel.NgModelController `ngModelController`}. To get a hold of the controller,
you require it in the directive as shown in the example below.

Each function in the `$validators` object receives the `modelValue` and the `viewValue`
as parameters. AngularJS will then call `$setValidity` internally with the function's return value
(`true`: valid, `false`: invalid). The validation functions are executed every time an input
is changed (`$setViewValue` is called) or whenever the bound `model` changes.
Validation happens after successfully running `$parsers` and `$formatters`, respectively.
Failed validators are stored by key in
{@link ngModel.NgModelController#$error `ngModelController.$error`}.

Additionally, there is the `$asyncValidators` object which handles asynchronous validation,
such as making an `$http` request to the backend. Functions added to the object must return
a promise that must be `resolved` when valid or `rejected` when invalid.
In-progress async validations are stored by key in
{@link ngModel.NgModelController#$pending `ngModelController.$pending`}.

In the following example we create two directives:
 * An `integer` directive that validates whether the input is a valid integer. For example,
 `1.23` is an invalid value, since it contains a fraction. Note that we validate the viewValue
 (the string value of the control), and not the modelValue. This is because input[number] converts
 the viewValue to a number when running the `$parsers`.

 * A `username` directive that asynchronously checks if a user-entered value is already taken.
 We mock the server request with a `$q` deferred.

<example module="form-example1" name="forms-async-validation">
  <file name="index.html">
    <form name="form" class="css-form" novalidate>
      <div>
        <label>
        Size (integer 0 - 10):
        <input type="number" ng-model="size" name="size"
               min="0" max="10" integer />{{size}}</label><br />
        <span ng-show="form.size.$error.integer">The value is not a valid integer!</span>
        <span ng-show="form.size.$error.min || form.size.$error.max">
          The value must be in range 0 to 10!</span>
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
        Username:
        <input type="text" ng-model="name" name="name" username />{{name}}</label><br />
        <span ng-show="form.name.$pending.username">Checking if this name is available...</span>
        <span ng-show="form.name.$error.username">This username is already taken!</span>
      </div>

    </form>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    var app = angular.module('form-example1', []);

    var INTEGER_REGEXP = /^-?\d+$/;
    app.directive('integer', function() {
      return {
        require: 'ngModel',
        link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
          ctrl.$validators.integer = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
            if (ctrl.$isEmpty(modelValue)) {
              // consider empty models to be valid
              return true;
            }

            if (INTEGER_REGEXP.test(viewValue)) {
              // it is valid
              return true;
            }

            // it is invalid
            return false;
          };
        }
      };
    });

    app.directive('username', function($q, $timeout) {
      return {
        require: 'ngModel',
        link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
          var usernames = ['Jim', 'John', 'Jill', 'Jackie'];

          ctrl.$asyncValidators.username = function(modelValue, viewValue) {

            if (ctrl.$isEmpty(modelValue)) {
              // consider empty model valid
              return $q.resolve();
            }

            var def = $q.defer();

            $timeout(function() {
              // Mock a delayed response
              if (usernames.indexOf(modelValue) === -1) {
                // The username is available
                def.resolve();
              } else {
                def.reject();
              }

            }, 2000);

            return def.promise;
          };
        }
      };
    });
  </file>
</example>

## Modifying built-in validators

Since AngularJS itself uses `$validators`, you can easily replace or remove built-in validators,
should you find it necessary. The following example shows you how to overwrite the email validator
in `input[email]` from a custom directive so that it requires a specific top-level domain,
`example.com` to be present.
Note that you can alternatively use `ng-pattern` to further restrict the validation.

<example module="form-example-modify-validators" name="forms-modify-validators">
  <file name="index.html">
    <form name="form" class="css-form" novalidate>
      <div>
        <label>
          Overwritten Email:
          <input type="email" ng-model="myEmail" overwrite-email name="overwrittenEmail" />
        </label>
        <span ng-show="form.overwrittenEmail.$error.email">This email format is invalid!</span><br>
        Model: {{myEmail}}
        </div>
    </form>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    var app = angular.module('form-example-modify-validators', []);

    app.directive('overwriteEmail', function() {
      var EMAIL_REGEXP = /^[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~.-]+@example\.com$/i;

      return {
        require: '?ngModel',
        link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
          // only apply the validator if ngModel is present and AngularJS has added the email validator
          if (ctrl && ctrl.$validators.email) {

            // this will overwrite the default AngularJS email validator
            ctrl.$validators.email = function(modelValue) {
              return ctrl.$isEmpty(modelValue) || EMAIL_REGEXP.test(modelValue);
            };
          }
        }
      };
    });
  </file>
</example>


## Implementing custom form controls (using `ngModel`)
AngularJS implements all of the basic HTML form controls ({@link ng.directive:input input},
{@link ng.directive:select select}, {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}),
which should be sufficient for most cases. However, if you need more flexibility,
you can write your own form control as a directive.

In order for custom control to work with `ngModel` and to achieve two-way data-binding it needs to:

  - implement `$render` method, which is responsible for rendering the data after it passed the
  {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$formatters `NgModelController.$formatters`},
  - call `$setViewValue` method, whenever the user interacts with the control and model
  needs to be updated. This is usually done inside a DOM Event listener.

See {@link guide/directive `$compileProvider.directive`} for more info.

The following example shows how to add two-way data-binding to contentEditable elements.

<example module="form-example2" name="forms-custom-form-controls">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div contentEditable="true" ng-model="content" title="Click to edit">Some</div>
    <pre>model = {{content}}</pre>

    <style type="text/css">
      div[contentEditable] {
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: #D0D0D0;
      }
    </style>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('form-example2', []).directive('contenteditable', function() {
      return {
        require: 'ngModel',
        link: function(scope, elm, attrs, ctrl) {
          // view -> model
          elm.on('blur', function() {
            ctrl.$setViewValue(elm.html());
          });

          // model -> view
          ctrl.$render = function() {
            elm.html(ctrl.$viewValue);
          };

# i18n and l10n

Internationalization (i18n) is the process of developing products in such a way that they can be
localized for languages and cultures easily. Localization (l10n), is the process of adapting
applications and text to enable their usability in a particular cultural or linguistic market. For
application developers, internationalizing an application means abstracting all of the strings and
other locale-specific bits (such as date or currency formats) out of the application. Localizing an
application means providing translations and localized formats for the abstracted bits.


## How does AngularJS support i18n/l10n?

AngularJS supports i18n/l10n for {@link ng.filter:date date}, {@link ng.filter:number number} and
{@link ng.filter:currency currency} filters.

Localizable pluralization is supported via the {@link ng.directive:ngPluralize `ngPluralize`
directive}.  Additionally, you can use {@link guide/i18n#messageformat-extensions MessageFormat extensions} to
`$interpolate` for localizable pluralization and gender support in all interpolations via the
`ngMessageFormat` module.

All localizable AngularJS components depend on locale-specific rule sets managed by the {@link
ng.$locale `$locale` service}.

There are a few examples that showcase how to use AngularJS filters with various locale rule sets in the
[`i18n/e2e` directory](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/i18n/e2e) of the AngularJS
source code.


## What is a locale ID?

A locale is a specific geographical, political, or cultural region. The most commonly used locale
ID consists of two parts: language code and country code. For example, `en-US`, `en-AU`, and
`zh-CN` are all valid locale IDs that have both language codes and country codes. Because
specifying a country code in locale ID is optional, locale IDs such as `en`, `zh`, and `sk` are
also valid. See the [ICU](http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale) website for more information
about using locale IDs.


## Supported locales in AngularJS

AngularJS separates number and datetime format rule sets into different files, each file for a
particular locale. You can find a list of currently supported locales
[here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/src/ngLocale)


## Providing locale rules to AngularJS

There are two approaches to providing locale rules to AngularJS:

### 1. Pre-bundled rule sets

You can pre-bundle the desired locale file with AngularJS by concatenating the content of the
locale-specific file to the end of `angular.js` or `angular.min.js` file.

For example on *nix, to create an angular.js file that contains localization rules for german
locale, you can do the following:

`cat angular.js i18n/angular-locale_de-de.js > angular_de-de.js`

When the application containing `angular_de-de.js` script instead of the generic angular.js script
starts, AngularJS is automatically pre-configured with localization rules for the german locale.

### 2. Including a locale script in `index.html`

You can also include the locale specific js file in the index.html page. For example, if one client
requires German locale, you would serve index_de-de.html which will look something like this:

```html
<html ng-app>
 <head>
….
   <script src="angular.js"></script>
   <script src="i18n/angular-locale_de-de.js"></script>
….
 </head>
</html>
```

### Comparison of the two approaches

Both approaches described above require you to prepare different `index.html` pages or JavaScript
files for each locale that your app may use. You also need to configure your server to serve
the correct file that corresponds to the desired locale.

The second approach (including the locale JavaScript file in `index.html`) may be slower because
an extra script needs to be loaded.


## Caveats

Although AngularJS makes i18n convenient, there are several things you need to be conscious of as you
develop your app.

### Currency symbol

AngularJS's {@link ng.filter:currency currency filter} allows you to use the default currency symbol
from the {@link ng.$locale locale service}, or you can provide the filter with a custom currency
symbol.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** If your app will be used only in one locale, it is fine to rely on the default
currency symbol. If you anticipate that viewers in other locales might use your app, you should
explicitly provide a currency symbol.
</div>

Let's say you are writing a banking app and you want to display an account balance of 1000 dollars.
You write the following binding using the currency filter:

```html
{{ 1000 | currency }}
```

If your app is currently in the `en-US` locale, the browser will show `$1000.00`. If someone in the
Japanese locale (`ja`) views your app, their browser will show a balance of `¥1000.00` instead.
This is problematic because $1000 is not the same as ¥1000.

In this case, you need to override the default currency symbol by providing the
{@link ng.filter:currency} currency filter with a currency symbol as a parameter.

If we change the above to `{{ 1000 | currency:"USD$"}}`, AngularJS will always show a balance of
`USD$1000` regardless of locale.

### Translation length

Translated strings/datetime formats can vary greatly in length. For example, `June 3, 1977` will be
translated to Spanish as `3 de junio de 1977`.

When internationalizing your app, you need to do thorough testing to make sure UI components behave
as expected even when their contents vary greatly in content size.

### Timezones

The AngularJS datetime filter uses the time zone settings of the browser. The same
application will show different time information depending on the time zone settings of the
computer that the application is running on. Neither JavaScript nor AngularJS currently supports
displaying the date with a timezone specified by the developer.


<a name="MessageFormat"></a>
## MessageFormat extensions

You can write localizable plural and gender based messages in AngularJS interpolation expressions and
`$interpolate` calls.

This syntax extension is provided by way of the `ngMessageFormat` module that your application can
depend upon (shipped separately as `angular-message-format.min.js` and `angular-message-format.js`.)
A current limitation of the `ngMessageFormat` module, is that it does not support redefining the
`$interpolate` start and end symbols. Only the default `{{` and `}}` are allowed.

The syntax extension is based on a subset of the ICU MessageFormat syntax that covers plurals and
gender selections.  Please refer to the links in the “Further Reading” section at the bottom of this
section.

You may find it helpful to play with the following example as you read the explanations below:

<example name="message-format-example" module="messageFormatExample" deps="angular-message-format.js">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="ckCtrl">
      <b>Set number of recipients</b>
      <button ng-click="setNumRecipients(0)">None</button>
      <button ng-click="setNumRecipients(1)">One</button>
      <button ng-click="setNumRecipients(2)">Two</button>
      <button ng-click="setNumRecipients(3)">Three</button>


      <br><br>
      <b>Sender's</b> name: <input ng-model="sender.name"> &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <br><br><b>Recipients</b><br>
      <div ng-repeat="recipient in recipients">
        Name: <input ng-model="recipient.name"> &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Gender: <button ng-click="setGender(recipient, 'male')">male</button>
                <button ng-click="setGender(recipient, 'female')">female</button>
                <button ng-click="setGender(recipient, 'other')">other</button>
      </div>

      <br><br><b>Message</b><br>

                    female {You ({{sender.name}}) gave her ({{recipients[0].name}}) a gift.}
                    other {You ({{sender.name}}) gave them ({{recipients[0].name}}) a gift.}
                }}
             }
          one { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,

             }
             other {You ({{sender.name}}) gave {{recipients.length}} people gifts. }
      }}

          person.gender = gender;
        };
      });
  </file>
</example>

### Plural Syntax

The syntax for plural based message selection looks like the following:

```text
{{NUMERIC_EXPRESSION, plural,
    =0 {MESSAGE_WHEN_VALUE_IS_0}
    =1 {MESSAGE_WHEN_VALUE_IS_1}
    =2 {MESSAGE_WHEN_VALUE_IS_2}
    =3 {MESSAGE_WHEN_VALUE_IS_3}
    ...
    zero {MESSAGE_WHEN_PLURAL_CATEGORY_IS_ZERO}
    one {MESSAGE_WHEN_PLURAL_CATEGORY_IS_ONE}
    two {MESSAGE_WHEN_PLURAL_CATEGORY_IS_TWO}
    few {MESSAGE_WHEN_PLURAL_CATEGORY_IS_FEW}
    many {MESSAGE_WHEN_PLURAL_CATEGORY_IS_MANY}
    other {MESSAGE_WHEN_THERE_IS_NO_MATCH}
}}
```

Please note that whitespace (including newline) is generally insignificant except as part of the
actual message text that occurs in curly braces.  Whitespace is generally used to aid readability.

Here, `NUMERIC_EXPRESSION` is an expression that evaluates to a numeric value based on which the
displayed message should change based on pluralization rules.

Following the AngularJS expression, you would denote the plural extension syntax by the `, plural,`
syntax element.  The spaces there are optional.

This is followed by a list of selection keyword and corresponding message pairs.  The "other"
keyword and corresponding message are **required** but you may have as few or as many of the other
categories as you need.

#### Selection Keywords

The selection keywords can be either exact matches or language dependent [plural
categories](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).

Exact matches are written as the equal sign followed by the exact value. `=0`, `=1`, `=2` and
`=123` are all examples of exact matches.  Note that there should be no space between the equal sign
and the numeric value.

Plural category matches are single words corresponding to the [plural
categories](http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules) of the CLDR plural category spec.
These categories vary by locale.  The "en" (English) locale, for example, defines just "one" and
"other" while the "ga" (Irish) locale defines "one", "two", "few", "many" and "other".  Typically,
you would just write the categories for your language.  During translation, the translators will add
or remove more categories depending on the target locale.

Exact matches always win over keyword matches.  Therefore, if you define both `=0` and `zero`, when
the value of the expression is zero, the `=0` message is the one that will be selected.  (The
duplicate keyword categories are helpful when used with the optional `offset` syntax described
later.)


#### Messages

Messages immediately follow a selection keyword and are optionally preceded by whitespace.  They are
written in single curly braces (`{}`).  They may contain AngularJS interpolation syntax inside them.
In addition, the `#` symbol is a placeholder for the actual numeric value of the expression.

### Simple plural example

```text
{{numMessages, plural,
      =0 {You have no new messages}
      =1 {You have one new message}
   other {You have # new messages}
}}
```

Because these messages can themselves contain AngularJS expressions, you could also write this as
follows:

```text
{{numMessages, plural,
      =0 {You have no new messages}
      =1 {You have one new message}
   other {You have {{numMessages}} new messages}
}}
```


### Plural syntax with optional `offset`

The plural syntax supports an optional `offset` syntax that is used in matching.  It's simpler to
explain this with an example.

```text
{{recipients.length, plural, offset:1
    =0    {You gave no gifts}
    =1    {You gave {{recipients[0].name}} a gift}
    one   {You gave {{recipients[0].name}} and one other person a gift}
    other {You gave {{recipients[0].name}} and # other people a gift}
}}
```

When an `offset` is specified, the matching works as follows.  First, the exact value of the AngularJS
expression is matched against the exact matches (i.e. `=N` selectors) to find a match.  If there is
one, that message is used.  If there was no match, then the offset value is subtracted from the
value of the expression and locale specific pluralization rules are applied to this new value to
obtain its plural category (such as “one”, “few”, “many”, etc.) and a match is attempted against the
keyword selectors and the matching message is used.  If there was no match, then the “other”
category (required) is used.  The value of the `#` character inside a message is the value of
original expression reduced by the offset value that was specified.

### Escaping / Quoting

You will need to escape curly braces or the `#` character inside message texts if you want them to
be treated literally with no special meaning.  You may quote/escape any character in your message
text by preceding it with a `\` (backslash) character.  The backslash character removes any special
meaning to the character that immediately follows it.  Therefore, you can escape or quote the
backslash itself by preceding it with another backslash character.


### Gender (aka select) Syntax

The gender support is provided by the more generic "select" syntax that is more akin to a switch
statement.  It is general enough to support use for gender based messages.

The syntax for gender based message selection looks like the following:

```text
{{EXPRESSION, select,
    male {MESSAGE_WHEN_EXPRESSION_IS_MALE}
    female {MESSAGE_WHEN_EXPRESSION_IS_FEMALE}
    ...
    other {MESSAGE_WHEN_THERE_IS_NO_GENDER_MATCH}
}}
```

Please note that whitespace (including newline) is generally insignificant except as part of the
actual message text that occurs in curly braces.  Whitespace is generally used to aid readability.

Here, `EXPRESSION` is an AngularJS expression that evaluates to the gender of the person that
is used to select the message that should be displayed.

The AngularJS expression is followed by `, select,` where the spaces are optional.

This is followed by a list of selection keyword and corresponding message pairs.  The "other"
keyword and corresponding message are **required** but you may have as few or as many of the other
gender values as you need (i.e. it isn't restricted to male/female.)  Note however, that the
matching is **case-sensitive**.

#### Selection Keywords

Selection keywords are simple words like "male" and "female".  The keyword, "other", and its
corresponding message are required while others are optional.  It is used when the AngularJS
expression does not match (case-insensitively) any of the other keywords specified.

#### Messages

Messages immediately follow a selection keyword and are optionally preceded by whitespace.  They are
written in single curly braces (`{}`).  They may contain AngularJS interpolation syntax inside them.

### Simple gender example

```text
{{friendGender, select,
       male {Invite him}
     female {Invite her}
      other {Invite them}
}}
```

### Nesting

As mentioned in the syntax for plural and select, the embedded messages can contain AngularJS
interpolation syntax.  Since you can use MessageFormat extensions in AngularJS interpolation, this
allows you to nest plural and gender expressions in any order.

Please note that if these are intended to reach a translator and be translated, it is recommended
that the messages appear as a whole and not be split up.

### Demonstration of nesting

This is taken from the above example.

```text
{{recipients.length, plural, offset:1
    =0 {You ({{sender.name}}) gave no gifts}
    =1 { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You ({{sender.name}}) gave him ({{recipients[0].name}}) a gift.}
              female {You ({{sender.name}}) gave her ({{recipients[0].name}}) a gift.}
              other {You ({{sender.name}}) gave them ({{recipients[0].name}}) a gift.}
          }}
       }
    one { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You ({{sender.name}}) gave him ({{recipients[0].name}}) and one other person a gift.}
              female {You ({{sender.name}}) gave her ({{recipients[0].name}}) and one other person a gift.}
              other {You ({{sender.name}}) gave them ({{recipients[0].name}}) and one other person a gift.}
          }}
       }
    other {You ({{sender.name}}) gave {{recipients.length}} people gifts. }
}}
```

### Differences from the ICU MessageFormat syntax

This section is useful to you if you're already familiar with the ICU MessageFormat syntax.

This syntax extension, while based on MessageFormat, has been designed to be backwards compatible
with existing AngularJS interpolation expressions.  The key rule is simply this: **All
interpolations are done inside double curlies.** The top level comma operator after an expression
inside the double curlies causes MessageFormat extensions to be recognized.  Such a top level comma
is otherwise illegal in an AngularJS expression and is used by MessageFormat to specify the function
(such as plural/select) and it's related syntax.

To understand the extension, take a look at the ICU MessageFormat syntax as specified by the ICU
documentation.  Anywhere in that MessageFormat that you have regular message text and you want to
substitute an expression, just put it in double curlies instead of single curlies that MessageFormat
dictates.  This has a huge advantage.  **You are no longer limited to simple identifiers for
substitutions**.  Because you are using double curlies, you can stick in any arbitrary interpolation
syntax there, including nesting more MessageFormat expressions!

# Internet Explorer Compatibility

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** AngularJS 1.3 has dropped support for IE8. Read more about it on
[our blog](https://blog.angularjs.org/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html).
AngularJS 1.2 will continue to support IE8, but the core team does not plan to spend time
addressing issues specific to IE8 or earlier.
</div>

This document describes the Internet Explorer (IE) idiosyncrasies when dealing with custom HTML
attributes and tags. Read this document if you are planning on deploying your AngularJS application
on IE.

The project currently supports and will attempt to fix bugs for IE9 and above. The continuous
integration server runs all unit tests against IE9, IE10, and IE11. See
[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/angular/workflows/angular.js/tree/master).

We do not run tests on IE8 and below. A subset of the AngularJS functionality may work on these
browsers, but it is up to you to test and decide whether it works for your particular app.


To ensure your AngularJS application works on IE please consider:

1. Use `ng-style` tags instead of `style="{{ someCss }}"`. The latter works in Chrome, Firefox,
   Safari and Edge but does not work in Internet Explorer (even 11).
2. For the `type` attribute of buttons, use `ng-attr-type` tags instead of
   `type="{{ someExpression }}"`. If using the latter, Internet Explorer overwrites the expression
   with `type="submit"` before AngularJS has a chance to interpolate it.
3. For the `value` attribute of progress, use `ng-attr-value` tags instead of
   `value="{{ someExpression}}"`. If using the latter, Internet Explorer overwrites the expression
   with `value="0"` before AngularJS has a chance to interpolate it.
4. For the `placeholder` attribute of textarea, use `ng-attr-placeholder` tags instead
   of `placeholder="{{ someExpression }}"`. If using the latter, Internet Explorer will error
   on accessing the `nodeValue` on a parentless `TextNode` in Internet Explorer 10 & 11
   (see [issue 5025](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5025)).
5. Using the `disabled` attribute on an element that has
   descendant form controls can result in unexpected behavior in Internet Explorer 11.
   For example, the value of descendant input elements with `ng-model` will not reflect
   the model (or changes to the model), and the value of the `placeholder` attribute will be
   inserted as the input's value. Descendant select elements will also be inoperable, as if they
   had the `disabled` attribute applied to them, which may not be the intended effect.
   To work around this unexpected behavior, 1) avoid using the identifier `disabled` for custom attribute
   directives that are on elements with descendant form controls, and 2) avoid using `disabled` as an identifier
   for an attribute passed to a custom directive that has descendant form controls.

## guide/interpolation.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name Interpolation
@sortOrder 275
@description

# Interpolation and data-binding

Interpolation markup with embedded {@link guide/expression expressions} is used by AngularJS to
provide data-binding to text nodes and attribute values.

An example of interpolation is shown below:

```html
<a ng-href="img/{{username}}.jpg">Hello {{username}}!</a>
```

### How text and attribute bindings work

During the compilation process the {@link ng.$compile compiler} uses the {@link ng.$interpolate $interpolate}
service to see if text nodes and element attributes contain interpolation markup with embedded expressions.

If that is the case, the compiler adds an interpolateDirective to the node and
registers {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches} on the computed interpolation function,
which will update the corresponding text nodes or attribute values as part of the
normal {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest digest} cycle.

Note that the interpolateDirective has a priority of 100 and sets up the watch in the preLink function.

### How the string representation is computed

If the interpolated value is not a `String`, it is computed as follows:
- `undefined` and `null` are converted to `''`
- if the value is an object that is not a `Number`, `Date` or `Array`, $interpolate looks for
a custom `toString()` function on the object, and uses that. Custom means that
`myObject.toString !== Object.prototype.toString`.
- if the above doesn't apply, `JSON.stringify` is used.

### Binding to boolean attributes

Attributes such as `disabled` are called `boolean` attributes, because their presence means `true` and
their absence means `false`. We cannot use normal attribute bindings with them, because the HTML
specification does not require browsers to preserve the values of boolean attributes. This means that
if we put an AngularJS interpolation expression into such an attribute then the binding information
would be lost, because the browser ignores the attribute value.

In the following example, the interpolation information would be ignored and the browser would simply
interpret the attribute as present, meaning that the button would always be disabled.

```html
  Disabled: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="isDisabled" />
  <button disabled="{{isDisabled}}">Disabled</button>
```

For this reason, AngularJS provides special `ng`-prefixed directives for the following boolean attributes:
{@link ngDisabled `disabled`}, {@link ngRequired `required`}, {@link ngSelected `selected`},
{@link ngChecked `checked`}, {@link ngReadonly `readOnly`} , and {@link ngOpen `open`}.

These directives take an expression inside the attribute, and set the corresponding boolean attribute
to true when the expression evaluates to truthy.

```html
  Disabled: <input type="checkbox" ng-model="isDisabled" />
  <button ng-disabled="isDisabled">Disabled</button>
```

### `ngAttr` for binding to arbitrary attributes

Web browsers are sometimes picky about what values they consider valid for attributes.

For example, considering this template:

```html
<svg>
  <circle cx="{{cx}}"></circle>
</svg>
```

We would expect AngularJS to be able to bind to this, but when we check the console we see
something like `Error: Invalid value for attribute cx="{{cx}}"`. Because of the SVG DOM API's
restrictions, you cannot simply write `cx="{{cx}}"`.

With `ng-attr-cx` you can work around this problem.

If an attribute with a binding is prefixed with the `ngAttr` prefix (denormalized as `ng-attr-`)
then during the binding it will be applied to the corresponding unprefixed attribute. This allows
you to bind to attributes that would otherwise be eagerly processed by browsers
(e.g. an SVG element's `circle[cx]` attributes). When using `ngAttr`, the `allOrNothing` flag of
{@link ng.$interpolate $interpolate} is used, so if any expression in the interpolated string
results in `undefined`, the attribute is removed and not added to the element.

For example, we could fix the example above by instead writing:

```html
<svg>
  <circle ng-attr-cx="{{cx}}"></circle>
</svg>
```

If one wants to modify a camelcased attribute (SVG elements have valid camelcased attributes),
such as `viewBox` on the `svg` element, one can use underscores to denote that the attribute to bind
to is naturally camelcased.

For example, to bind to `viewBox`, we can write:

```html
<svg ng-attr-view_box="{{viewBox}}">
</svg>
```

Other attributes may also not work as expected when they contain interpolation markup, and
can be used with `ngAttr` instead. The following is a list of known problematic attributes:

- **size** in `<select>` elements (see [issue 1619](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1619))
- **placeholder** in `<textarea>` in Internet Explorer 10/11 (see [issue 5025](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5025))
- **type** in `<button>` in Internet Explorer 11 (see [issue 14117](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5025))
- **value** in `<progress>` in Internet Explorer = 11 (see [issue 7218](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7218))

## Known Issues

### Dynamically changing an interpolated value

You should avoid dynamically changing the content of an interpolated string (e.g. attribute value
or text node). Your changes are likely to be overwritten, when the original string gets evaluated.
This restriction applies to both directly changing the content via JavaScript or indirectly using a
directive.

For example, you should not use interpolation in the value of the `style` attribute (e.g.
`style="color: {{ 'orange' }}; font-weight: {{ 'bold' }};"`) **and** at the same time use a
directive that changes the content of that attribute, such as `ngStyle`.

### Embedding interpolation markup inside expressions

<div class="alert alert-danger">
**Note:** AngularJS directive attributes take either expressions *or* interpolation markup with embedded expressions.
It is considered **bad practice** to embed interpolation markup inside an expression:
</div>

```html
<div ng-show="form{{$index}}.$invalid"></div>
```

You should instead delegate the computation of complex expressions to the scope, like this:

```html
<div ng-show="getForm($index).$invalid"></div>
```

```js
  function getForm(index) {
    return $scope['form' + index];
  }
```

You can also access the `scope` with `this` in your templates:

```html
<div ng-show="this['form' + $index].$invalid"></div>
```

#### Why mixing interpolation and expressions is bad practice:

- It increases the complexity of the markup
- There is no guarantee that it works for every directive, because interpolation itself is a directive.
If another directive accesses attribute data before interpolation has run, it will get the raw
interpolation markup and not data.
- It impacts performance, as interpolation adds another watcher to the scope.
- Since this is not recommended usage, we do not test for this, and changes to
AngularJS core may break your code.

# What Is AngularJS?

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template
language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and
succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you
would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it
an ideal partner with any server technology.

AngularJS is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. HTML is a great
declarative language for static documents. It does not contain much in the way of creating
applications, and as a result building web applications is an exercise in *what do I have to do
to trick the browser into doing what I want?*

The impedance mismatch between dynamic applications and static documents is often solved with:

  * **a library** - a collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is
    in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. E.g., `jQuery`.
  * **frameworks** - a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in
    the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something
    app specific. E.g., `durandal`, `ember`, etc.


AngularJS takes another approach. It attempts to minimize the impedance mismatch between document
centric HTML and what an application needs by creating new HTML constructs. AngularJS teaches the
browser new syntax through a construct we call *directives*. Examples include:

  * Data binding, as in `{{}}`.
  * DOM control structures for repeating, showing and hiding DOM fragments.
  * Support for forms and form validation.
  * Attaching new behavior to DOM elements, such as DOM event handling.
  * Grouping of HTML into reusable components.



## A complete client-side solution

AngularJS is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web
application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a
well-defined structure. This makes AngularJS opinionated about how a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
application should be built. But while it is opinionated, it also tries to make sure that its opinion
is just a starting point you can easily change. AngularJS comes with the following out-of-the-box:

  * Everything you need to build a CRUD app in a cohesive set: Data-binding, basic templating
    directives, form validation, routing, deep-linking, reusable components and dependency injection.
  * Testability story: Unit-testing, end-to-end testing, mocks and test harnesses.
  * Seed application with directory layout and test scripts as a starting point.


## AngularJS's sweet spot

AngularJS simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the
developer. Like any abstraction, it comes at a cost of flexibility. In other words, not every app
is a good fit for AngularJS. AngularJS was built with the CRUD application in mind. Luckily CRUD
applications represent the majority of web applications. To understand what AngularJS is
good at, though, it helps to understand when an app is not a good fit for AngularJS.

Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation.
These kinds of apps are different from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for AngularJS.
In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower level of abstraction, such as `jQuery`.

## The Zen of AngularJS

AngularJS is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes
to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for
expressing business logic.


  * It is a very good idea to decouple DOM manipulation from app logic. This dramatically improves
    the testability of the code.
  * It is a really, _really_ good idea to regard app testing as equal in importance to app
    writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.
  * It is an excellent idea to decouple the client side of an app from the server side. This
    allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.
  * It is very helpful indeed if the framework guides developers through the entire journey of
    building an app: From designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.
  * It is always good to make common tasks trivial and difficult tasks possible.



AngularJS frees you from the following pains:

  * **Registering callbacks:** Registering callbacks clutters your code, making it hard to see the
    forest for the trees. Removing common boilerplate code such as callbacks is a good thing. It
    vastly reduces the amount of JavaScript coding _you_ have to do, and it makes it easier to see
    what your application does.
  * **Manipulating HTML DOM programmatically:** Manipulating HTML DOM is a cornerstone of AJAX
    applications, but it's cumbersome and error-prone. By declaratively describing how the UI
    should change as your application state changes, you are freed from low-level DOM manipulation
    tasks. Most applications written with AngularJS never have to programmatically manipulate the
    DOM, although you can if you want to.
  * **Marshaling data to and from the UI:** CRUD operations make up the majority of AJAX
    applications' tasks. The flow of marshaling data from the server to an internal object to an HTML
    form, allowing users to modify the form, validating the form, displaying validation errors,
    returning to an internal model, and then back to the server, creates a lot of boilerplate
    code. AngularJS eliminates almost all of this boilerplate, leaving code that describes the
    overall flow of the application rather than all of the implementation details.
  * **Writing tons of initialization code just to get started:** Typically you need to write a lot
    of plumbing just to get a basic "Hello World" AJAX app working. With AngularJS you can bootstrap
    your app easily using services, which are auto-injected into your application in a
    [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice)-like dependency-injection style. This allows you
    to get started developing features quickly. As a bonus, you get full control over the
    initialization process in automated tests.

@name Migrating from Previous Versions
@sortOrder 550
@description

# Migrating an App to a newer version

Minor version releases in AngularJS introduce several breaking changes that may require changes to your
application's source code; for instance from 1.0 to 1.2 and from 1.2 to 1.3.

Although we try to avoid breaking changes, there are some cases where it is unavoidable:

* AngularJS has undergone thorough security reviews to make applications safer by default,
which drives many of these changes.
* Several new features, especially animations, would not be possible without a few changes.
* Finally, some outstanding bugs were best fixed by changing an existing API.

## Migrating from 1.7 to 1.8

Generally updating to 1.8.0 from 1.7.x should be a straightforward process and is highly recommended.
AngularJS 1.8 is a breaking change release from 1.7 to mitigate a security issue.

JqLite no longer turns XHTML-like strings like `<div /><span />` to sibling elements when not in XHTML
mode: `<div></div><span></span>`.
Instead it will leave the elements alone. In non-XHTML mode the browser will convert these to nested
elements: `<div><span></span></div>`.

This is a security fix to avoid an XSS vulnerability if a new jqLite element is created from a
user-controlled HTML string. If you must have this functionality and understand the risk involved
then it is posible to restore the original behavior by calling

```js
angular.UNSAFE_restoreLegacyJqLiteXHTMLReplacement();
```

But you should adjust your code for this change and remove your use of this function as soon as
possible.

Note that this only patches jqLite. If you use jQuery 3.5.0 or newer, please read the
[jQuery 3.5 upgrade guide](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/) for more details about the workarounds.


## Migrating from 1.6 to 1.7

AngularJS 1.7 contains bug fixes and features to AngularJS core and its external modules, some of
which contain breaking changes. However, most of these address internal behavior and not APIs, and
should not affect many applications.
Additionally, we have removed some long-deprecated modules and APIs.

The most notable changes are:

- `$resource` has now support for request and requestError interceptors

- Several deprecated features have been removed:
    - the `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` flag
    - the `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled()` flag
    - the `angular.lowercase` and `angular.uppercase` methods
    - the `$cookieStore` service from the `ngCookies` module
    - the `ngClick` override directive and corresponding services from the `ngTouch` module
    - the complete `ngScenario` module

Please note that feature development (without breaking changes) has happened in parallel on the
1.6.x branch, so 1.7 doesn't contain many new features, but you may still benefit from those
features that were added (with possible BCs), bugfixes, and a few smaller performance improvements.


<br />
Below is the full list of breaking changes:


<br />
<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ng-directives"></a>
### Core: _Directives_


#### **form**

**Due to [223de5](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/223de59e988dc0cc8b4ec3a045b7c0735eba1c77)**,
forms will now set `$submitted` on child forms when they are submitted.
For example:
```
<form name="parentform" ng-submit="$ctrl.submit()">
  <ng-form name="childform">
    <input type="text" name="input" ng-model="my.model" />
  </ng-form>
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Submitting this form will set `$submitted` on "parentform" and "childform".
Previously, it was only set on "parentform".

This change was introduced because mixing `form` and `ngForm` does not create
logically separate forms, but rather something like input groups.
Therefore, child forms should inherit the submission state from their parent form.


#### **input[radio]** and **input[checkbox]**

**Due to [656c8f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/656c8fa8f23b1277cc5c214c4d0237f3393afa1e)**,
`input[radio]` and `input[checkbox]` now listen to the "change" event instead of the "click" event.
Most apps should not be affected, as "change" is automatically fired by browsers after "click"
happens.

Two scenarios might need migration:

- Custom click events:

Before this change, custom click event listeners on radio / checkbox would be called after the
input element and `ngModel` had been updated, unless they were specifically registered before
the built-in click handlers.
After this change, they are called before the input is updated, and can call
`event.preventDefault()` to prevent the input from updating.

If an app uses a click event listener that expects `ngModel` to be updated when it is called, it now
needs to register a change event listener instead.

- Triggering click events:

Conventional trigger functions:

The change event might not be fired when the input element is not attached to the document. This
can happen in **tests** that compile input elements and trigger click events on them. Depending on
the browser (Chrome and Safari) and the trigger method, the change event will not be fired when the
input isn't attached to the document.

Before:

```js
it('should update the model', inject(function($compile, $rootScope) {
  var inputElm = $compile('<input type="checkbox" ng-model="checkbox" />')($rootScope);

  inputElm[0].click(); // Or different trigger mechanisms, such as jQuery.trigger()
  expect($rootScope.checkbox).toBe(true);
});
```

With this patch, `$rootScope.checkbox` might not be true, because the click event hasn't triggered
the change event. To make the test, work append `inputElm` to the app's `$rootElement`, and the
`$rootElement` to the `$document`.

After:

```js
it('should update the model', inject(function($compile, $rootScope, $rootElement, $document) {
  var inputElm = $compile('<input type="checkbox" ng-model="checkbox" />')($rootScope);

  $rootElement.append(inputElm);
  $document.append($rootElement);

  inputElm[0].click(); // Or different trigger mechanisms, such as jQuery.trigger()
  expect($rootScope.checkbox).toBe(true);
});
```


#### **input\[number\]**

**Due to [aa3f95](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/aa3f951330ec7b10b43ea884d9b5754e296770ec)**,
`input[type=number]` with `ngModel` now validates the input for the `max`/`min` restriction against
the `ngModelController.$viewValue` instead of against the `ngModelController.$modelValue`.

This affects apps that use `$parsers` or `$formatters` to transform the input / model value.

If you rely on the `$modelValue` validation, you can overwrite the `min`/`max` validator from a
custom directive, as seen in the following example directive definition object:

```js
{
  restrict: 'A',
  require: 'ngModel',
  link: function(scope, element, attrs, ctrl) {
    var maxValidator = ctrl.$validators.max;

    ctrl.$validators.max = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
      return maxValidator(modelValue, modelValue);
    };
  }
}
```


#### **ngModel, input**

**Due to [74b04c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/74b04c9403af4fc7df5b6420f22c9f45a3e84140)**,
*Custom* parsers that fail to parse on input types "email", "url", "number", "date", "month",
"time", "datetime-local", "week", no longer set `ngModelController.$error[inputType]`, and
the `ng-invalid-[inputType]` class. Also, custom parsers on input type "range" no longer set `ngModelController.$error.number` and the `ng-invalid-number` class.

Instead, any custom parsers on these inputs set `ngModelController.$error.parse` and
`ng-invalid-parse`. This change was made to make distinguishing errors from built-in parsers
and custom parsers easier.


#### **ngModelOptions**

**Due to [55ba44](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/55ba44913e02650b56410aa9ab5eeea5d3492b68)**,
the 'default' key in 'debounce' now only debounces the default event, i.e. the event that is added
as an update trigger by the different input directives automatically.

Previously, it also applied to other update triggers defined in 'updateOn' that
did not have a corresponding key in the 'debounce'.

This behavior is now supported via a special wildcard / catch-all key: '*'.

See the following example:

Pre-1.7:
'mouseup' is also debounced by 500 milliseconds because 'default' is applied:
```html
ng-model-options="{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 }
}"
```

1.7:
The pre-1.7 behavior can be re-created by setting '*' as a catch-all debounce value:
```html
ng-model-options="{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { '*': 500, 'blur': 0 }
}"
```

In contrast, when only 'default' is used, 'blur' and 'mouseup' are not debounced:
```html
ng-model-options="{
  updateOn: 'default blur mouseup',
  debounce: { 'default': 500 }
}
```


#### **ngStyle**

**Due to [15bbd3](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/15bbd3e18cd89b91f7206a06c73d40e54a8a48a0)**,
the use of deep-watching in `ngStyle` has changed. Previously, `ngStyle` would trigger styles to be
re-applied whenever nested state changed. Now, only changes to direct properties of the watched
object will trigger changes.


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ng-services"></a>
### Core: _Services_


#### **$compile**

**Due to [38f8c9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/38f8c97af74649ce224b6dd45f433cc665acfbfb)**,
directive bindings are no longer available in the constructor.

Previously, the `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled` flag was supported.
The flag controlled whether bindings were available inside the controller
constructor or only in the `$onInit` hook. The bindings are now no longer
available in the constructor.

To migrate your code:

1. If you haven't invoked `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled()` you
don't have to do anything to migrate.

2. If you specified `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(false)`, you
can remove that statement - since AngularJS 1.6.0 this is the default so your
app should still work even in AngularJS 1.6 after such removal. Afterwards,
migrating to AngularJS 1.7.0 shouldn't require any further action.

3. If you specified `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true)` you need
to first migrate your code so that the flag can be flipped to `false`. The
instructions on how to do that are available in the "Migrating from 1.5 to 1.6"
guide: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration#migrating-from-1-5-to-1-6
Afterwards, remove the `$compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true)`
statement.

<hr />

**Due to [6ccbfa](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6ccbfa65d60a3dc396d0cf6da21b993ad74653fd)**,
the `xlink:href` security context for SVG's `a` and `image` elements has been lowered.

In the unlikely case that an app relied on `RESOURCE_URL` trusted list for the
purpose of binding to the `xlink:href` property of SVG's `<a>` or `<image>`
elements and if the values do not pass the regular URL sanitization, they will
break.

To fix this you need to ensure that the values used for binding to the affected
`xlink:href` contexts are considered safe URLs, e.g. by trusting them in
`$compileProvider`'s `aHrefSanitizationWhitelist` (called `aHrefSanitizationTrustedUrlList` form
1.8.1 onwards) (for `<a>` elements) or `imgSrcSanitizationWhitelist` (called
`imgSrcSanitizationTrustedUrlList` from 1.8.1 onwards) (for `<image>` elements).

<hr />

**Due to [fd4f01](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fd4f0111188b62773b99ab6eab38b4d2b5d8d727)**,
deep-watching is no longer used in literal one-way bindings.

Previously, when a literal value was passed into a directive/component via
one-way binding it would be watched with a deep watcher.

For example, for `<my-component input="[a]">`, a new instance of the array
would be passed into the directive/component (and trigger `$onChanges`) not
only if `a` changed but also if any sub property of `a` changed such as
`a.b` or `a.b.c.d.e` etc.

This also means a new but equal value for `a` would NOT trigger such a
change.

Now, literal values use an input-based watch similar to other directive/component
one-way bindings. In this context inputs are the non-constant parts of the
literal. In the example above, the input would be `a`. Changes are only
triggered, when the inputs to the literal change.

<hr />

**Due to [1cf728](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1cf728e209a9e0016068fac2769827e8f747760e)**,
`base[href]` was added to the list of `RESOURCE_URL` context attributes.

Previously, `<base href="{{ $ctrl.baseUrl }}" />` would not require `baseUrl` to
be trusted as a `RESOURCE_URL`. Now, `baseUrl` will be sent to `$sce`'s
`RESOURCE_URL` checks. By default, it will break unless `baseUrl` is of the same
origin as the application document.

Refer to the
[`$sce` API docs](https://code.angularjs.org/snapshot/docs/api/ng/service/$sce)
for more info on how to trust a value in a `RESOURCE_URL` context.

Also, concatenation in trusted contexts is not allowed, which means that the
following won't work: `<base href="/something/{{ $ctrl.partialPath }}" />`.

Either construct complex values in a controller (recommended):

```js
this.baseUrl = '/something/' + this.partialPath;
```
```html
<base href="{{ $ctrl.baseUrl }}" />
```

Or use string concatenation in the interpolation expression (not recommended
except for the simplest of cases):

```html
<base href="{{ '/something/' + $ctrl.partialPath }}" />
```


#### **$rootScope**

**Due to ([c2b8fa](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c2b8fab0a480204374d561d6b9b3d47347ac5570))**,
the arguments of `$watchGroup` callbacks have changed.

Previously, when using `$watchGroup`, the entries in `newValues` and
`oldValues` represented the *most recent change of each entry*.

Now, the entries in `oldValues` will always equal the `newValues` of the previous
call of the listener. This means comparing the entries in `newValues` and
`oldValues` can be used to determine which individual expressions changed.

For example `$scope.$watchGroup(['a', 'b'], fn)` would previously:

|  Action  |  newValue  |  oldValue  |
|----------|------------|------------|
|  (init)  | [undefined, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=1`   | [1, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=2`   | [2, undefined] | [1, undefined] |
|  `b=3`   | [2, 3] | [1, undefined] |


Now the `oldValue` will always equal the previous `newValue`:

|  Action  |  newValue  |  oldValue  |
|----------|------------|------------|
|  (init)  | [undefined, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=1`   | [1, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=2`   | [2, undefined] | [1, undefined] |
|  `b=3`   | [2, 3] | [2, undefined] |

Note the last call now shows `a === 2` in the `oldValues` array.

This also makes the `oldValue` of one-time watchers more clear. Previously,
the `oldValue` of a one-time watcher would remain `undefined` forever. For
example `$scope.$watchGroup(['a', '::b'], fn)` would previously:

|  Action  |  newValue  |  oldValue  |
|----------|------------|------------|
|  (init)  | [undefined, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=1`   | [1, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `b=2`   | [1, 2] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=b=3` | [3, 2] | [1, undefined] |

Where now the `oldValue` will always equal the previous `newValue`:

|  Action  |  newValue  |  oldValue  |
|----------|------------|------------|
|  (init)  | [undefined, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `a=1`   | [1, undefined] | [undefined, undefined] |
|  `b=2`   | [1, 2] | [1, undefined] |
|  `a=b=3` | [3, 2] | [1, 2] |


#### **$interval**

**Due to [a8bef9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a8bef95127775d83d80daa4617c33227c4b443d4)**,
`$interval.cancel()` will throw an error if called with a promise that was not generated by
`$interval()`. Previously, it would silently do nothing.

Before:
```js
var promise = $interval(doSomething, 1000, 5).then(doSomethingElse);
$interval.cancel(promise);  // No error; interval NOT canceled.
```

After:
```js
var promise = $interval(doSomething, 1000, 5).then(doSomethingElse);
$interval.cancel(promise);  // Throws error.
```

Correct usage:
```js
var promise = $interval(doSomething, 1000, 5);
var newPromise = promise.then(doSomethingElse);
$interval.cancel(promise);  // Interval canceled.
```


#### **$timeout**

**Due to [336525](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3365256502344970f86355d3ace1cb4251ae9828)**,
`$timeout.cancel()` will throw an error if called with a promise that was not generated by
`$timeout()`. Previously, it would silently do nothing.

Before:
```js
var promise = $timeout(doSomething, 1000).then(doSomethingElse);
$timeout.cancel(promise);  // No error; timeout NOT canceled.
```

After:
```js
var promise = $timeout(doSomething, 1000).then(doSomethingElse);
$timeout.cancel(promise);  // Throws error.
```

Correct usage:
```js
var promise = $timeout(doSomething, 1000);
var newPromise = promise.then(doSomethingElse);
$timeout.cancel(promise);  // Timeout canceled.
```


#### **$cookies**

**Due to [73c646](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/73c6467f1468353215dc689c019ed83aa4993c77)**,
the `$cookieStore`service has been removed. Migrate to the `$cookies` service. Note that
for object values you need to use the `putObject` & `getObject` methods, as
`get`/`put` will not correctly save/retrieve the object values.

Before:
```js
$cookieStore.put('name', {key: 'value'});
$cookieStore.get('name'); // {key: 'value'}
$cookieStore.remove('name');
```


#### **$templateRequest**

**Due to [c617d6](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c617d6dceee5b000bfceda44ced22fc16b48b18b)**,
the `tpload` error namespace has changed. Previously, the `tpload` error was namespaced to
`$compile`. If you have code that matches errors of the form `[$compile:tpload]` it will no longer
run. You should change the code to match `[$templateRequest:tpload]`.

<hr />

**Due to ([fb0099](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fb00991460cf69ae8bc7f1f826363d09c73c0d5e)**,
`$templateRequest()` now returns the result of `$templateCache.put()` when making a server request
for a template. Previously, it would return the content of the response directly.

This means that if you are decorating `$templateCache.put()` to manipulate the template, you will
now get this manipulated result also on the first `$templateRequest()` call rather than only on
subsequent calls (when the template is retrieved from the cache).

In practice, this should not affect any apps, as it is unlikely that they rely on the template being
different in the first and subsequent calls.


#### **$animate**

**Due to [16b82c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/16b82c6afe0ab916fef1d6ca78053b00bf5ada83)**,
`$animate.cancel(runner)` now rejects the underlying promise and calls the `catch()` handler on the
runner returned by `$animate` functions (`enter`, `leave`, `move`, `addClass`, `removeClass`,
`setClass`, `animate`).
Previously, it would resolve the promise as if the animation had ended successfully.

Example:

```js
var runner = $animate.addClass('red');
runner.then(function() { console.log('success')});
runner.catch(function() { console.log('cancelled')});

runner.cancel();
```

Pre-1.7.0, this logs 'success', 1.7.0 and later it logs 'cancelled'.
To migrate, add a `catch()` handler to your animation runners.


#### **$controller**

**Due to [e269c1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e269c14425a3209040f65c022658770e00a36f16)**,
the option to instantiate controllers from constructors on the global `window` object
has been removed. Likewise, the deprecated `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()`
method that could enable this behavior, has been removed.

This behavior had been deprecated since AngularJS v1.3.0, because polluting the global scope
is considered bad practice. To migrate, remove the call to `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` in
the config, and register your controller via the Module API or the `$controllerProvider`, e.g.:

```js
angular.module('myModule', []).controller('myController', function() {...});

// or

angular.module('myModule', []).config(function($controllerProvider) {
  $controllerProvider.register('myController', function() {...});
});
```


#### **$sce**

**Due to [1e9ead](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1e9eadcd72dbbd5c67dae8328a63e535cfa91ff9)**,
if you use `attrs.$set` for URL attributes (`a[href]` and `img[src]`) there will no
longer be any automated sanitization of the value. This is in line with other
programmatic operations, such as writing to the `innerHTML` of an element.

If you are programmatically writing URL values to attributes from untrusted
input, then you must sanitize it yourself. You could write your own sanitizer or copy
the private `$$sanitizeUri` service.

Note that values that have been passed through the `$interpolate` service within the
`URL` or `MEDIA_URL` will have already been sanitized, so you would not need to sanitize
these values again.

<hr/>

**Due to [1e9ead](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1e9eadcd72dbbd5c67dae8328a63e535cfa91ff9)**,
binding {@link ng.$sce#trustAs trustAs()} and the short versions
({@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl trustAsResourceUrl()} et al.) to {@link ng.ngSrc},
{@link ng.ngSrcset}, and {@link ng.ngHref} will now raise an infinite digest error:

```js
$scope.imgThumbFn = function(id) {
  return $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(someService.someUrl(id));
};
```

```html
<img ng-src="{{ imgThumbFn(imgId) }}" />
```

This is because {@link ng.$interpolate} is now responsible for sanitizing
the attribute value, and its watcher receives a new object from `trustAs()`
on every digest.
To migrate, compute the trusted value only when the input value changes:

```js
$scope.$watch('imgId', function(id) {
  $scope.imgThumb = $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(someService.someUrl(id));
});
```

```html
<img ng-src="{{ imgThumb }}" />
```


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ng-filters"></a>
### Core: _Filters_


#### **orderBy**

**Due to [1d8046](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1d804645f7656d592c90216a0355b4948807f6b8)**,
when using `orderBy` to sort arrays containing `null` values, the `null` values
will be considered "greater than" all other values, except for `undefined`.
Previously, they were sorted as strings. This will result in different (but more
intuitive) sorting order.

Before:
```js
orderByFilter(['a', undefined, 'o', null, 'z']);
//--> 'a', null, 'o', 'z', undefined
```

After:
```js
orderByFilter(['a', undefined, 'o', null, 'z']);
//--> 'a', 'o', 'z', null, undefined
```


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ng-misc"></a>
### Core: _Miscellaneous_


#### **jqLite**

**Due to [b7d396](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b7d396b8b6e8f27a1f4556d58fc903321e8d532a)**,
`removeData()` no longer removes event handlers.

Before this commit `removeData()` invoked on an element removed its event
handlers as well. If you want to trigger a full cleanup of an element, change:

```js
elem.removeData();
```

to:

```js
angular.element.cleanData(elem);
```

In most cases, though, cleaning up after an element is supposed to be done
only when it's removed from the DOM as well; in such cases the following:

```js
elem.remove();
```

will remove event handlers as well.


#### **Helpers**

**Due to [1daa4f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1daa4f2231a89ee88345689f001805ffffa9e7de)**,
the helper functions `angular.lowercase` and `angular.uppercase` have been removed.

These functions have been deprecated since 1.5.0. They are internally
used, but should not be exposed as they contain special locale handling
(for Turkish) to maintain internal consistency regardless of user-set locale.

Developers should generally use the built-in methods `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase`
or `toLocaleLowerCase` and `toLocaleUpperCase` for special cases.

<hr />

**Due to [e3ece2](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e3ece2fad9e1e6d47b5f06815ff186d7e6f44948)**,
`angular.isArray()` now supports Array subclasses.

Previously, `angular.isArray()` was an alias for `Array.isArray()`.
Therefore, objects that prototypally inherit from `Array` where not
considered arrays. Now such objects are considered arrays too.

This change affects several other methods that use `angular.isArray()`
under the hood, such as `angular.copy()`, `angular.equals()`,
`angular.forEach()`, and `angular.merge()`.

This in turn affects how dirty checking treats objects that prototypally
inherit from `Array` (e.g. MobX observable arrays). AngularJS will now
be able to handle these objects better when copying or watching.


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ngAria"></a>
### ngAria

**Due to [6d5ef3](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6d5ef34fc6a974cde73157ba94f9706723dd8f5b)**,
`ngAria` no longer sets `aria-*` attributes on `input[type="hidden"]` with `ngModel`.
This can affect apps that test for the presence of ARIA attributes on hidden inputs.
To migrate, remove these assertions.
In actual apps, this should not have a user-facing effect, as the previous behavior
was incorrect, and the new behavior is correct for accessibility.


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ngResource"></a>
### ngResource


#### **$resource**

**Due to [ea0585](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/ea0585773bb93fd891576e2271254a17e15f1ddd)**,
the behavior of interceptors and success/error callbacks has changed.

If you are not using `success` or `error` callbacks with `$resource`,
your app should not be affected by this change.

If you are using `success` or `error` callbacks (with or without
response interceptors), one (subtle) difference is that throwing an
error inside the callbacks will not propagate to the returned
`$promise`. Therefore, you should try to use the promises whenever
possible. E.g.:

```js
// Avoid
User.query(function onSuccess(users) { throw new Error(); }).
  $promise.
  catch(function onError() { /* Will not be called. */ });

// Prefer
User.query().
  $promise.
  then(function onSuccess(users) { throw new Error(); }).
  catch(function onError() { /* Will be called. */ });
```

Finally, if you are using `success` or `error` callbacks with response
interceptors, the callbacks will now always run _after_ the interceptors
(and wait for them to resolve in case they return a promise).
Previously, the `error` callback was called before the `responseError`
interceptor and the `success` callback was synchronously called after
the `response` interceptor. E.g.:

```js
var User = $resource('/api/users/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {
    method: 'get',
    interceptor: {
      response: function(response) {
        console.log('responseInterceptor-1');
        return $timeout(1000).then(function() {
          console.log('responseInterceptor-2');
          return response.resource;
        });
      },
      responseError: function(response) {
        console.log('responseErrorInterceptor-1');
        return $timeout(1000).then(function() {
          console.log('responseErrorInterceptor-2');
          return $q.reject('Ooops!');
        });
      }
    }
  }
});
var onSuccess = function(value) { console.log('successCallback', value); };
var onError = function(error) { console.log('errorCallback', error); };

// Assuming the following call is successful...
User.get({id: 1}, onSuccess, onError);
  // Old behavior:
  //   responseInterceptor-1
  //   successCallback, {/* Promise object */}
  //   responseInterceptor-2
  // New behavior:
  //   responseInterceptor-1
  //   responseInterceptor-2
  //   successCallback, {/* User object */}

// Assuming the following call returns an error...
User.get({id: 2}, onSuccess, onError);
  // Old behavior:
  //   errorCallback, {/* Response object */}
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-1
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-2
  // New behavior:
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-1
  //   responseErrorInterceptor-2
  //   errorCallback, Ooops!
```

<hr />

**Due to [240a3d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/240a3ddbf12a9bb79754031be95dae4b6bd2dded)**,
`$http` will be called asynchronously from `$resource` methods
(regardless if a `request`/`requestError` interceptor has been defined).

Previously, calling a `$resource` method would synchronously call
`$http`.

This is not expected to affect applications at runtime, since the
overall operation is asynchronous already, but may affect assertions in
tests. For example, if you want to assert that `$http` has been called
with specific arguments as a result of a `$resource` call, you now need
to run a `$digest` first, to ensure the (possibly empty) request
interceptor promise has been resolved.

Before:
```js
it('...', function() {
  $httpBackend.expectGET('/api/things').respond(...);
  var Things = $resource('/api/things');
  Things.query();

  expect($http).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
});
```

After:
```js
it('...', function() {
  $httpBackend.expectGET('/api/things').respond(...);
  var Things = $resource('/api/things');
  Things.query();
  $rootScope.$digest();

  expect($http).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
});
```


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ngScenario"></a>
### ngScenario

**Due to[0cd392](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/0cd39217828b0ad53eaf731576af17d66c18ff60)**,
the angular scenario runner end-to-end test framework has been
removed from the project and will no longer be available on npm
or bower starting with 1.7.0.
It has been deprecated and removed from the documentation since 2014.
Applications that still use it should migrate to
[Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org).
Technically, it should also be possible to continue using an
older version of the scenario runner, as the underlying APIs have
not changed. However, we do not guarantee future compatibility.


<a name="migrate1.6to1.7-ngTouch"></a>
### ngTouch

**Due to [11d9ad](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/11d9ad1eb25eaf5967195e424108207427835d50)**,
the `ngClick` directive of the `ngTouch` module has been removed, and with it the
corresponding `$touchProvider` and `$touch` service.

If you have included `ngTouch` v1.5.0 or higher in your application, and have not
changed the value of `$touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled()`, or injected and used the `$touch`
service, then there are no migration steps for your code. Otherwise you must remove references to
the provider and service.

The `ngClick` override directive had been deprecated and by default disabled since v1.5.0,
because of buggy behavior in edge cases, and a general trend to avoid special touch based
overrides of click events. In modern browsers, it should not be necessary to use a touch override
library:

- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari remove the 300ms delay when
  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` is set.
- Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Chrome remove the delay on elements that have the
  `touch-action` css property is set to `manipulation`.

## Migrating from 1.5 to 1.6

AngularJS 1.6 fixes numerous bugs and adds new features, both in core and in external modules.
In addition, it includes several security and performance improvements in commonly used services,
such as `$compile`, `$injector`, `$parse`, `$animate`, and directives, such as `input`, `ngModel`
and `select`.


The most notable changes are:

- Aligning jqLite with the latest version of jQuery (3.x).
- Implementing long awaited features, such as support for inputs of type `range` and the ability to
  bind to any type of values using `ngRepeat` with `select`.
- Disabling (by default) the pre-assignment of bindings on controller instances, which helps with
  support for native ES6 classes.
- Changing the default `$location` hash-prefix to `'!'`, as the previous empty string default was
  unconventional and confusing.
- Reporting possibly unhandled promise rejections that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Another major change is the removal of the **Expression Sandbox**. This should not require changes
to your application (and may give it a small performance boost), but we strongly recommend reading
the [Sandbox Removal Blog Post](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/09/angular-16-expression-sandbox-removal.html)
to understand the implications behind the removal and whether any action is required on your part.


<br />
You may also notice that this release comes with a longer-than-usual list of breaking changes. Don't
let this dishearten you though, since most of them are pretty minor - often not expected to affect
real applications. These breaking changes were necessary in order to:

- Align with breaking changes in jQuery 3.
- Fix bugs that we wouldn't be able to fix otherwise.
- Introduce new features, performance improvements and security fixes.
- Make the behavior of existing features more consistent and predictable.


<br />
To give you a heads-up, here is a brief summary of the breaking changes that are expected to have
the highest impact. Make sure you look them up in the full list below or check out the corresponding
commits for more info.

- **$location** now uses `'!'` as the default hash-prefix for hash-bang URLs, instead of the empty
  string. ([Details](guide/migration#commit-aa077e8))

- **$compile** will (by default) not pre-assign bindings on component/directive controller
  instances. ([Details](guide/migration#commit-bcd0d4))

- **http** imposes additional restrictions to **JSONP** requests for security reasons
  (see [details](guide/migration#migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$http) below):
  - The request URL now needs to be trusted as a resource URL.
  - You can no longer use the `JSON_CALLBACK` placeholder for specifying the query parameter for the
    callback.



- **jqLite** is more aligned to jQuery 3, which required the following changes
  (see [details](guide/migration#migrate1.5to1.6-ng-misc-jqLite) below):
  - Keys passed to `.data()` and `.css()` are now camelCased in the same way as the jQuery methods
    do.
  - Getting/setting boolean attributes no longer takes the corresponding properties into account.
  - Setting boolean attributes to empty string no longer removes the attribute.
  - Calling `.val()` on a multiple select will always return an array, even if no option is
    selected.



- **input[type=radio]** now uses strict comparison (`===`) to determine its "checked" status.
  ([Details](guide/migration#commit-5ac7da))

- The improved support for **input[type=range]** means that the behaviour of range inputs (when
  bound to `ngModel`) has changed. ([Details](guide/migration#commit-913016))

- **ngTransclude** now treats whitespace-only transclusion content as empty and uses the fallback
  content instead. ([Details](guide/migration#commit-32aa7e))

- **ngAria/ngModel** no longer overrides the default `$inEmpty()` method for custom
  `checkbox`-shaped controls. ([Details](guide/migration#commit-975a61))

`FormController` now defines its methods on its prototype, instead of on each instance. As a
consequence, `FormController` methods always need to be called in the correct context. For example
`$scope.$watch('something', myFormCtrl.$setDirty)` will no longer work, because the `$setDirty`
method is passed without any context. The code must now be changed to:

```js
$scope.$watch('something', function() {
  myFormCtrl.$setDirty();
})
```

or you can use `Function.prototype.bind` or `angular.bind`.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-input[number]"></a>
#### **input[type=number]**:

<minor />
**Due to [e1da4be](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e1da4bed8e291003d485a8ad346ab80bed8ae2e3)**,
number inputs that use `ngModel` and specify a `step` constraint (via `step`/`ngStep` attributes)
will now have a new validator (`step`), which will verify that the current value is valid under the
`step` constraint (according to the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-step-attribute)).
Previously, the `step` constraint was ignored by `ngModel`, treating values as valid even when there
was a step-mismatch.

If you want to restore the previous behavior (use the `step` attribute while disabling step
validation), you can overwrite the built-in `step` validator with a custom directive. For example:

```js
// For all `input` elements...
.directive('input', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    require: '?ngModel',
    link: function (scope, elem, attrs, ngModelCtrl) {
      // ...that are of type "number" and have `ngModel`...
      if ((attrs.type === 'number') && ngModelCtrl) {
        // ...remove the `step` validator.
        delete ngModelCtrl.$validators.step;
      }
    }
  };
})
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-input[radio]"></a>
#### **input[type=radio]**:

<major />
<a name="commit-5ac7da"></a>
**Due to [5ac7da](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/5ac7daea72ec31cf337d1d21b13f0d17ff33994f)**,
the "checked" status of radio inputs is now determined by doing a strict comparison (`===`) between
the value of the input and the `ngModelController.$viewValue`. Previously, this was a non-strict
comparison (`==`).

This means in the following examples the radio is no longer checked:

```html
<!-- this.selected = 0 -->
<input type="radio" ng-model="$ctrl.selected" value="0" />

<!-- this.selected = 0; this.value = false; -->
<input type="radio" ng-model="$ctrl.selected" ng-value="$ctrl.value" />
```

If your code relied on the non-strict comparison, you need to convert the values so that they
continue to match with strict comparison.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-input[range]"></a>
#### **input[type=range]**:

<major />
<a name="commit-913016"></a>
**Due to [913016](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/9130166767c4792c5d32d08a918fc7becf32c9a6)**
and the built-in support for range inputs, the behavior of such elements when bound to `ngModel`
will be different than before:

- Like `input[type=number]`, it requires the model to be a Number, and will set the model to a
  Number.
- It supports setting the min/max values only via the min/max attributes.
- It follows the browser behavior of never allowing an invalid value. That means, when the browser
  converts an invalid value (empty: `null`, `undefined`, `false` ..., out of bounds: greater than
  max, less than min) to a valid value, the input will in turn set the model to this new valid value
  via `$setViewValue`.
  - This means a range input will never have the required validation error and never have a
    non-Number model value, once the `ngModel` directive is initialized.
  - This behavior is supported when the model changes and when the min/max attributes change in a
    way that prompts the browser to update the input value.
- Browsers that do not support `input[type=range]` (IE9) handle the input like a number input (with
  validation etc).


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-ngBind"></a>
#### **ngBind**:

<minor />
**Due to [fa80a6](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fa80a61a05a3b49a2c770d5544cb8480907a18d3)**,
`ngBind` now uses the same logic as `$interpolate` (i.e. `{{ myObject }}`) when binding, which means
values other than strings are now transformed as follows:
- `null`/`undefined` become the empty string.
- If an object is not Array, Number or Date and has a custom `toString()` function, use that.
- Otherwise use `JSON.stringify()`.

Previously, `ngBind` would always use `toString()`. The following examples show the difference:

```js
$scope.myPlainObject = {a: 1, b: 2};
$scope.myCustomObject = {a: 1, b: 2, toString: function() { return 'a+b'; }};
```

Plain Object:

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<span ng-bind="myPlainObject">[object Object]</span>

<!-- After: -->
<span ng-bind="myPlainObject">{'a':1,'b':2}</span>
```

Object with custom `toString()`:

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<span ng-bind="myCustomObject">[object Object]</span>

<!-- After: -->
<span ng-bind="myCustomObject">a+b</span>
```

If you want the output of `toString()`, you can call it manually on the value in `ngBind`:

```html
<span ng-bind="myObject.toString()">[object Object]</span>
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-ngModel"></a>
#### **ngModel**:

<minor />
**Due to [9e24e7](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/9e24e774a558143b3478536911a3a4c1714564ba)**,
`NgModelController` now defines its methods on its prototype, instead of on each instance. As a
consequence, `NgModelController` methods always need to be called in the correct context. For example
`$scope.$watch('something', myNgModelCtrl.$setDirty)` will no longer work, because the `$setDirty`
method is passed without any context. The code must now be changed to:

```js
$scope.$watch('something', function() {
  myNgModelCtrl.$setDirty();
})
```

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [7bc71a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7bc71adc63bb6bb609b44dd2d3ea8fb0cd3f300b)**,
the values returned by synchronous validators are always treated as boolean. Previously, only a
literal `false` return value would cause the validation to fail. Now, _all_ falsy values will cause
the validation to fail, as one would naturally expect.

Specifically, the values `0`, `null`, `NaN` and `''` (the empty string) used to cause the validation
to pass and they will now cause it to fail. The value `undefined` was treated similarly to a pending
asynchronous validator, causing the validation to be pending. `undefined` is now also treated as
`false`.

If your synchronous validators are always returning boolean values (which should already be the case
for most applications anyway), then this change does not affect you. If not, make sure you always
return a boolean value (`true/false`) indicating whether the input is valid or not.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-ngModelOptions"></a>
#### **ngModelOptions**:

<minor />
**Due to [296cfc](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/296cfce40c25e9438bfa46a0eb27240707a10ffa)**,
the programmatic API for `ngModelOptions` has changed. You must now read options via the
`ngModelController.$options.getOption(name)` method, rather than accessing the option directly as a
property of the `ngModelContoller.$options` object. One benefit of these changes, though, is that
the `ngModelControler.$options` property is now guaranteed to be defined so there is no need to
check before accessing.

This does not affect the usage in templates and only affects custom directives that might have been
reading options for their own purposes. If you were programmatically accessing the options, you need
to change your code as follows:

Before:

```js
var myOption = ngModelController.$options && ngModelController.$options['my-option'];
```

After:

```js
var myOption = ngModelController.$options.getOption('my-option');
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-ngTransclude"></a>
#### **ngTransclude**:

<major />
<a name="commit-32aa7e"></a>
**Due to [32aa7e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/32aa7e7395527624119e3917c54ee43b4d219301)**,
if you only provide whitespace as the transclusion content, it will be assumed to be empty and the
fallback content will be used instead. Previously, whitespace only transclusion would be treated as
the transclusion being "not empty", which meant that fallback content was not used in that case.

If you actually want whitespace to appear as the transcluded content, then you can force it to be
used by adding an HTML comment to the whitespace:

```html
<my-component>
  <!-- Use this as transclusion content even if empty. -->
</my-component>
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-directives-select"></a>
#### **select**:

<tests-only />
**Due to [f02b70](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/f02b707b5e4a5ffd1e1a20d910754cfabfc19622)**,
using `ngValue` on `<option>` elements inside a `<select ng-model>` will automatically set values on
them in hash form (used internally by `select` to map to the corresponding model value). I.e.
`<option ng-value="myString">` will become `<option ng-value="myString" value="string:myString">`.

This is necessary in order to support binding options with values of any type to selects and should
hardly affect any applications, as the values of options are usually not relevant to the
application logic. (Although, it may affect tests that check the `value` attribute of `<option>`
elements.)

<hr />
<tests-only />
**Due to [e8c2e1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e8c2e119758e58e18fe43932d09a8ff9f506aa9d)**,
`<option>` elements will no longer have their value attribute set from their text value when their
`<select>` element doesn't have `ngModel` associated with it. Setting the value is only needed for
the select directive to match model values and options. If `ngModel` is not present, the `select`
directive doesn't need it.

This should not affect many applications as the behavior was undocumented and not part of the public
API. It also has no effect on the usual HTML5 behavior that sets the select value to the option text
if the option does not provide a value attribute.

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services"></a>
### Core: _Services_

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$compile"></a>
#### **$compile**:

<major />
<a name="commit-bcd0d4"></a>
**Due to [bcd0d4](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/bcd0d4d896d0dfdd988ff4f849c1d40366125858)**,
pre-assigning bindings on component/directive controller instances is disabled by default, which
means that they will no longer be available inside the constructors. It is still possible to turn it
back on, which should help during the migration. Pre-assigning bindings has been deprecated and will
be removed in a future version, so we strongly recommend migrating your applications to not rely on
it as soon as possible.

Initialization logic that relies on bindings being present should be put in the controller's
`$onInit()` method, which is guaranteed to always be called _after_ the bindings have been assigned.

Before:

```js
.component('myComponent', {
  bindings: {value: '<'},
  controller: function() {
    // `this.value` might or might not be initialized,
    // based on whether `preAssignBindingsEnabled` is true or false.
    this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;
  }
})
```

After:

```js
.component('myComponent', {
  bindings: {value: '<'},
  controller: function() {
    this.$onInit = function() {
      // `this.value` will always be initialized,
      // regardless of the value of `preAssignBindingsEnabled`.
      this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;
    };
  }
})
```

If you need to, you can re-enabled this feature with the following configuration block:

```js
.config(function($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true);
})
```

**Note:**
This will re-enable the feature for the whole application, so only do it if you are in control of
the whole application. If you are writing a library, you need to change your code as shown above.
Furthermore, if your library also targets versions before 1.5 (which do not support the `$onInit()`
lifecycle hook), you may need to manually call `$onInit()` from your constructor:

```js
.directive('myComponent', function() {
  return {
    scope: {value: '<'},
    controller: function() {
      // Put initialization logic inside `$onInit()`
      // to make sure bindings have been initialized.
      this.$onInit = function() {
        this.doubleValue = this.value * 2;
      };

      // Prior to v1.5, we need to call `$onInit()` manually.
      // (Bindings will always be pre-assigned in these versions.)
      if (angular.version.major === 1 && angular.version.minor < 5) {
        this.$onInit();
      }
    }
  };
})
```

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [04cad4](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/04cad41d26ebaf44b5ee0c29a152d61f235f3efa)**,
`link[href]` attributes are now protected via `$sce`, which prevents interpolated values that fail
the `RESOURCE_URL` context tests from being used in interpolation. For example if the application is
running at `https://docs.angularjs.org` then the following will fail:

```html
<link href="{{ 'http://mydomain.org/unsafe.css' }}" rel="stylesheet" />
```

By default, only URLs with the same domain and protocol as the application document are considered
safe in the `RESOURCE_URL` context. To use URLs from other domains and/or protocols, you may either
add them to the trusted source URL list or wrap them into a trusted value by calling `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url)`.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [97bbf8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/97bbf86a1979d099802f0d631c17c54b87563b40)**,
whitespace in attributes is no longer trimmed automatically. This includes leading and trailing
whitespace, and attributes that are purely whitespace. To migrate, attributes that require trimming
must now be trimmed manually. A common case where stray whitespace can cause problems is when
attribute values are compared, for example in `$observe`.

Before:

```js
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal === 'some value') ...
});
```

After:

```js
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal.trim() === 'some value') ...
});
```

Note that `$parse` trims expressions automatically, so attributes with expressions (e.g. directive
bindings) should not be affected by this change.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [13c252](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/13c2522baf7c8f616b2efcaab4bffd54c8736591)**,
on **IE11 only**, consecutive text nodes will always get merged. Previously, they would not get
merged if they had no parent. The new behavior, which fixes an IE11 bug affecting interpolation
under certain circumstances, might in some edge-cases have unexpected side effects that you should
be aware of. Please, check the commit message for more details.

**Due to [b89c21](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b89c2181a9a165e06c027390164e08635ec449f4)**,
using interpolation in any `on*` event attribute (e.g. `<button onclick="{{myVar}}">`) will now
throw the `nodomevents` error at compile time. Previously, the `nodomevents` was thrown at link
time. This change is not expected to affect any applications, as it is related to incorrect API use
that should not make it to production apps in the first place.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$http"></a>

<a name="commit-fb6634"></a>
**Due to [fb6634](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fb663418710736161a6b5da49c345e92edf58dcb)**,
you can no longer use the `JSON_CALLBACK` placeholder in your JSONP requests. Instead you must
provide the name of the query parameter that will pass the callback via the `jsonpCallbackParam`
property of the config object, or app-wide via the `$http.defaults.jsonpCallbackParam` property,
which is `"callback"` by default.

Before:

```js
$http.json('trusted/url?callback=JSON_CALLBACK');
$http.json('other/trusted/url', {params: {cb: 'JSON_CALLBACK'}});
```

After:

```js
$http.json('trusted/url');
$http.json('other/trusted/url', {jsonpCallbackParam: 'cb'});
```

<a name="commit-6476af"></a>
**Due to [6476af](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6476af83cd0418c84e034a955b12a842794385c4)**,
all JSONP requests now require the URL to be trusted as a resource URL. There are two approaches to
trust a URL:

1. **Setting trusted resource URLs with the `$sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist()` (called `trustedResourceUrlList()` from 1.8.1 onwards) method.**
   You configure this list in a module configuration block:

    ```js
    appModule.config(['$sceDelegateProvider', function($sceDelegateProvider) {
      $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([
        // Allow same origin resource loads.
        'self',
        // Allow JSONP calls that match this pattern
        'https://some.dataserver.com/**.jsonp?**'
      ]);
    }]);
    ```

2. **Explicitly trusting the URL via the `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url)` method.**
   You can pass a trusted object instead of a string as a URL to the `$http` service:

    ```js
    var promise = $http.jsonp($sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url));
    ```

<hr />
<tests-only />
**Due to [4f6f2b](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/4f6f2bce4ac93b85320e42e5023c09d099779b7d)**,
HTTP requests now update the outstanding request count synchronously. Previously, the request count
would not have been updated until the request to the server was actually in flight. Now the request
count is updated before any async interceptor is called.

The new behavior will also allow end-2-end tests to more correctly detect when AngularJS is stable,
but there is a chance it may change the observed behaviour in cases where an async request
interceptor is being used.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [b54a39](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b54a39e2029005e0572fbd2ac0e8f6a4e5d69014)**,
`$http`'s deprecated custom callback methods - `success()` and `error()` - have been removed. You
can use the standard `then()`/`catch()` promise methods instead, but note that the method signatures
and return values are different.

`success(fn)` can be replaced with `then(fn)`, and `error(fn)` can be replaced with either
`then(null, fn)` or `catch(fn)`.

Before:

```js
$http(...).
  success(function onSuccess(data, status, headers, config) {
    // Handle success
    ...
  }).
  error(function onError(data, status, headers, config) {
    // Handle error
    ...
  });
```

After:

```js
$http(...).
  then(function onSuccess(response) {
    // Handle success
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  }, function onError(response) {
    // Handle error
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  });

// or

$http(...).
  then(function onSuccess(response) {
    // Handle success
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  }).
  catch(function onError(response) {
    // Handle error
    var data = response.data;
    var status = response.status;
    var statusText = response.statusText;
    var headers = response.headers;
    var config = response.config;
    ...
  });
```

**Note:**
There is a subtle difference between the variations showed above. When using
`$http(...).success(onSuccess).error(onError)` or `$http(...).then(onSuccess, onError)`, the
`onError()` callback will only handle errors/rejections produced by the `$http()` call. If the
`onSuccess()` callback produces an error/rejection, it won't be handled by `onError()` and might go
unnoticed. In contrast, when using `$http(...).then(onSuccess).catch(onError)`, `onError()` will
handle errors/rejections produced by both `$http()` _and_ `onSuccess()`.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$interpolate"></a>
#### **$interpolate**:

<minor />
**Due to [a5fd2e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a5fd2e4c0376676fa317e09a8d8be4966b82cbfe)**,
when converting values to strings, interpolation now uses a custom `toString()` function on objects
that are not Number, Array or Date (custom means that the `toString` function is not the same as
`Object.prototype.toString`). Otherwise, interpolation uses `JSON.stringify()` as usual. If an
object has a custom `toString()` function, but you still want the output of `JSON.stringify()`, you
will need to manually convert to JSON (as shown below).

Before:

```html
<span>{{ myObject }}</span>
```

After:

```html
<span>{{ myObject | json }}</span>
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$location"></a>
#### **$location**:

<major />
<a name="commit-aa077e8"></a>
**Due to [aa077e8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/aa077e81129c740041438688dff2e8d20c3d7b52)**,
the default hash-prefix used for `$location` hash-bang URLs has changed from the empty string (`''`)
to the bang (`'!'`). If your application does not use HTML5 mode or is being run on browsers that do
not support HTML5 mode, and you have not specified your own hash-prefix then client side URLs will
now contain a `!` prefix. For example, rather than `mydomain.com/#/a/b/c` the URL will become
`mydomain.com/#!/a/b/c`.

If you actually want to have no hash-prefix, then you can restore the previous behavior by adding a
configuration block to you application:

```js
appModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
  $locationProvider.hashPrefix('');
}]);
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-services-$q"></a>
#### **$q**:

<minor />
**Due to [e13eea](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e13eeabd7e34a78becec06cfbe72c23f2dcb85f9)**,
an error thrown from a promise's `onFulfilled` or `onRejection` handlers is treated exactly the same
as a regular rejection. Previously, it would also be passed to the `$exceptionHandler()` (in
addition to rejecting the promise with the error as reason).

The new behavior applies to all services/controllers/filters etc that rely on `$q` (including
built-in services, such as `$http` and `$route`). For example, `$http`'s `transformRequest/Response`
functions or a route's `redirectTo` function as well as functions specified in a route's `resolve`
object, will no longer result in a call to `$exceptionHandler()` if they throw an error. Other than
that, everything will continue to behave in the same way; i.e. the promises will be rejected, route
transition will be cancelled, `$routeChangeError` events will be broadcasted etc.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [c9dffde](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c9dffde1cb167660120753181cb6d01dc1d1b3d0)**,
possibly unhandled rejected promises will be logged to the `$exceptionHandler`. Normally, that means
that an error will be logged to the console, but in tests `$exceptionHandler` will (by default)
re-throw any exceptions.
Tests that are affected by this change (e.g. tests that depend on specific order or number of
messages in `$exceptionHandler`) will need to handle rejected promises.

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-misc"></a>
### Core: _Miscellaneous_

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-misc-jqLite"></a>
#### **jqLite**:

<major />
**Due to [fc0c11](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fc0c11db845d53061430b7f05e773dcb3fb5b860)**,
jqLite will camelCase the keys passed to the `.data()` method, in the same way as jQuery 3+ does;
i.e. single hyphens followed by a lowercase letter will be converted to an uppercase letter.
Previously, keys passed to `.data()` were left untouched.

For example, with this change, the keys `a-b` and `aB` will now represent the same data piece;
writing to one of them will also be reflected when reading the value of the other one.

To migrate, you need to update your code as shown in the following examples:

Before:

```js
/* 1 */
elem.data('my-key', 2);
elem.data('myKey', 3);

/* 2 */
elem.data('foo-bar', 42);
elem.data()['foo-bar']; // 42
elem.data()['fooBar']; // undefined

/* 3 */
elem.data()['foo-bar'] = 1;
elem.data()['fooBar'] = 2;
elem.data('foo-bar'); // 1
```

After:

```js
/* 1 */
// Rename one of the keys as they would now map to the same data slot.
elem.data('my-key', 2);
elem.data('my-key2', 3);

**Due to [73050c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/73050cdda04675bfa6705dc841ddbbb6919eb048)**,
the way jqLite camelCases keys passed to `.css()` is aligned with jQuery. Previously, when using
AngularJS without jQuery, `.css()` would camelCase keys more aggressively. Now, only a single hyphen
followed by a lowercase letter is getting transformed. This change also affects other APIs that rely
on the `.css()` method, such as `ngStyle`.

If you are using AngularJS with jQuery, your application is not affected by this change. If you are
not using jQuery, then you need to update your code as shown in the following examples:

Before:

```html
<!-- HTML -->

<!-- All five versions used to be equivalent. -->
<div ng-style={background_color: 'blue'}></div>
<div ng-style={'background:color': 'blue'}></div>
<div ng-style={'background-color': 'blue'}></div>
<div ng-style={'background--color': 'blue'}></div>
<div ng-style={backgroundColor: 'blue'}></div>
```
```js
// JS

// All five versions used to be equivalent.
elem.css('background_color', 'blue');
elem.css('background:color', 'blue');
elem.css('background-color', 'blue');
elem.css('background--color', 'blue');
elem.css('backgroundColor', 'blue');

// All five versions used to be equivalent.
var bgColor = elem.css('background_color');
var bgColor = elem.css('background:color');
var bgColor = elem.css('background-color');
var bgColor = elem.css('background--color');
var bgColor = elem.css('backgroundColor');
```

After:

```html
<!-- HTML -->

<!-- Only these two versions are still equivalent to the five shown above. -->
<div ng-style={'background-color': 'blue'}></div>
<div ng-style={backgroundColor: 'blue'}></div>
```
```js
// JS

// Only these two versions are still equivalent to the five shown above.
elem.css('background-color', 'blue');
elem.css('backgroundColor', 'blue');

// Only these two versions are still equivalent to the five shown above.
var bgColor = elem.css('background-color');
var bgColor = elem.css('backgroundColor');
```

**Due to [7ceb5f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7ceb5f6fcc43d35d1b66c3151ce6a71c60309304)**,
getting/setting boolean attributes will no longer take the corresponding properties into account.
Previously, all boolean attributes were reflected into the corresponding property when calling a
setter and from the corresponding property when calling a getter, even on elements that don't treat
those attributes in a special way. Now AngularJS doesn't do it by itself, but relies on browsers to
know when to reflect the property. Note that this browser-level conversion differs between browsers;
if you need to dynamically change the state of an element, you should modify the property, not the
attribute. See https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#attr-versus-prop- for a more detailed
description about a related change in jQuery 1.9.

This change aligns jqLite with jQuery 3. To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

```css
/* CSS */

input[checked="checked"] { ... }
```
```js
// JS

elem1.attr('checked', 'checked');
elem2.attr('checked', false);
```

After:

```css
/* CSS */

input:checked { ... }
```
```js
// JS

elem1.prop('checked', true);
elem2.prop('checked', false);
```

**Due to [3faf45](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3faf4505732758165083c9d21de71fa9b6983f4a)**,
calling `.attr(attrName, '')` (with `attrName` being a boolean attribute) will no longer remove the
attribute, but set it to its lowercase name as happens for every non-empty string. Previously,
calling `.attr(attrName, '')` would remove the boolean attribute.

If you want to remove a boolean attribute now, you have to call `.attr()` with `false` or `null`.
E.g.: `.attr(attrName, false)`

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [4e3624](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/4e3624552284d0e725bf6262b2e468cd2c7682fa)**,
calling `.attr(attrName, null)` will remove the attribute. Previously, it would set the
`attrName` attribute value to the string `'null'`. If you want to set the attribute value to the
string `'null'`, you have to explicitly call `.attr(attrName, 'null')`.

<hr />
<major />
**Due to [d882fd](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/d882fde2e532216e7cf424495db1ccb5be1789f8)**,
calling the `.val()` getter on a jqLite element representing a `<select multiple>` element with no
options chosen will return an empty array. Previously, it would return `null`. If you relied on the
returned value being `null` or falsy, you need to change your code to check for a length of 0
instead:

Before:

```html
<select multiple>...</select>
```
```js
var value = $element.val();
if (value) { /* do something */ }
```

After:

```html
<select multiple>...</select>
```
```js
var value = $element.val();
if (value.length > 0) { /* do something */ }
```


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ng-misc-decorator"></a>
#### **decorator()**:

<minor />
**Due to [6a2ebd](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6a2ebdba5df27e789e3cb10f11eedf90f7b9b97e)**,
`module.decorator` declarations are now processed as part of the `module.config` queue and may
result in providers being decorated in a different order if `module.config` blocks are also used to
decorate providers via `$provide.decorator`.

For example, consider the following declaration order in which `'theFactory'` is decorated by both a
`module.decorator` and a `$provide.decorator`:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .config(function($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('theFactory', provideDecoratorFn);
  })
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn);
```

Before this change, `'theFactory'` provider would be decorated in the following order:
1. `moduleDecoratorFn`
2. `provideDecoratorFn`

After this change, the order in which `'theFactory'` is decorated will be different, because now
`module.decorator` declarations are processed in the same order as `module.config` declarations:
1. `provideDecoratorFn`
2. `moduleDecoratorFn`

### ngAria

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ngAria-$aria"></a>
#### **$aria**:

<minor />
**Due to [ad41ba](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/ad41baa1fdc057db3fe529ff87735b173b164b4c)**,
if you were explicitly setting the value of the `bindKeypress` flag, you need to change your code to
use `bindKeydown` instead.

Before: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeypress: xyz})`<br />
After: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeydown: xyz})`


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ngAria-ngClick"></a>
#### **ngClick**:

<minor />
**Due to [ad41ba](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/ad41baa1fdc057db3fe529ff87735b173b164b4c)**,
`ngClick` will respond to the `keydown` keyboard event, instead of the `keypress`. Also, if the
element already has any of the `ngKeydown`/`ngKeyup`/`ngKeypress` directives, `ngAria` will _not_
bind to the `keydown` event, since it assumes that the developer has already taken care of keyboard
interaction for that element. Although it is not expected to affect many applications, it might be
desirable to keep the previous behavior of binding to the `keypress` event instead of the `keydown`.
In that case, you need to manually use the `ngKeypress` directive (in addition to `ngClick`).

Before:

```html
<div ng-click="onClick()">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
```

After:

```html
<div ng-click="onClick()" ng-keypress="onClick()">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
<!-- OR -->
<div ng-click="onClick()">
  I respond to `click` and `keydown` (not `keypress`)
</div>
```

Finally, it is possible that this change affects your unit or end-to-end tests. If you are currently
expecting your custom buttons to automatically respond to the `keypress` event (due to `ngAria`),
you need to change the tests to trigger `keydown` events instead.


<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ngAria-ngModel"></a>
#### **ngModel**:

<major />
<a name="commit-975a61"></a>
**Due to [975a61](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/975a6170efceb2a5e6377c57329731c0636eb8c8)**,
custom `checkbox`-shaped controls (e.g. checkboxes, menuitemcheckboxes), no longer have a custom
`$isEmpty()` method on their `NgModelController` that checks for `value === false`. Unless
overwritten, the default `$isEmpty()` method will be used, which treats `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`
and `''` as "empty".

**Note:** The `$isEmpty()` method is used to determine if the checkbox is checked ("not empty" means
          "checked"). Thus it can indirectly affect other things, such as the control's validity
          with respect to the `required` validator (e.g. "empty" + "required" --> "invalid").

Before:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role="checkbox" ng-model="value"></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false
```

After:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role="checkbox" ng-model="value"></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true
```

If you want to have a custom `$isEmpty()` method, you need to overwrite the default. For example:

```js
.directive('myCheckbox', function myCheckboxDirective() {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    link: function myCheckboxPostLink(scope, elem, attrs, ngModelCtrl) {
      ngModelCtrl.$isEmpty = function myCheckboxIsEmpty(value) {
        return !value;   // Any falsy value means "empty"

        // Or to restore the previous behavior:
        // return value === false;
      };
    }
  };
})
```

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [9978de1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/9978de11b7295fec1a2f4cb8fbeb9b62b54cb711)**,
the `role` attribute will no longer be added to native control elements (textarea, button, select,
summary, details, a, and input). Previously, `role` was not added to `input`, but all others in the
list.
This should not affect accessibility, because native inputs are accessible by default, but it might
affect applications that relied on the `role` attribute being present (e.g. for styling or as
directive attributes).

**Due to [267ee9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/267ee9c892b0eb40908700ee2435793f8c6c1c84)**,
calling `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` will trigger a digest. This will ensure that
requests fired asynchronously will also be detected (without the need to manually trigger a digest).
This is not expected to affect the majority of test-suites. Most of the time, a digest is (directly
or indirectly) triggered anyway, before calling `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`. In the unlikely case
that a test needs to verify the timing of a request with respect to the digest cycle, you should
rely on other means, such as mocking and/or spying.

<hr />
<tests-only />
**Due to [7551b8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7551b8975a91ee286cc2cf4af5e78f924533575e)**,
it is no longer valid to explicitly pass `undefined` as the `url` argument to any of the
`$httpBackend.when...()` and `$httpBackend.expect...()` methods. While this argument is optional, it
must have a defined value if provided. Previously passing an explicit `undefined` value was ignored,
but this lead to invalid tests passing unexpectedly.

**Due to [acb545](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/acb545ec3ebf099db68561033645941c900973b5)**,
all own properties of the `params` object that are not used to replace URL params, will be passed to
`$http` as `config.params` (to be used as query parameters in the URL). Previously, parameters where
omitted if `Object.prototype` had a property with the same name. E.g.:

Before:

```js
var Foo = $resource('/foo/:id');
Foo.get({id: 42, bar: 'baz', toString: 'hmm'});
    // URL: /foo/42?bar=baz
    // Note that `toString` is _not_ included in the query,
    // because `Object.prototype.toString` is defined :(
```

After:

```js
var Foo = $resource('/foo/:id');
Foo.get({id: 42, bar: 'baz', toString: 'hmm'});
    // URL: /foo/42?bar=baz&toString=hmm
    // Note that `toString` _is_ included in the query, as expected :)
```

**Due to [2456ab](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/2456ab63a613902d21c151445f9c697a76ab43b3)**,
semicolon has been added to the list of delimiters that are not encoded in URL params. Although it
shouldn't matter in practice (since both the encoded and the unencoded `;` character would be
interpreted identically by the server), this change could break some tests: For example, where
`$httpBackend` was set up to expect an encoded `;` character, but the request is made to the URL
with an unencoded `;` character.

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ngRoute"></a>
### ngRoute

<a name="migrate1.5to1.6-ngRoute-$route"></a>
#### **$route**:

<tests-only />
**Due to [c13c66](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c13c666728c1a1485ef18e92d7cb35118ce39609)**,
`$route` (and its dependencies; e.g. `$location`) will - by default - be instantiated early on.
Previously, in cases where `ngView` was loaded asynchronously, `$route` (and its dependencies) might
also have been instantiated asynchronously.

Although this is not expected to have unwanted side-effects in normal application behavior, it may
affect your unit tests: When testing a module that (directly or indirectly) depends on `ngRoute`, a
request will be made for the default route's template. If not properly "trained", `$httpBackend`
will complain about this unexpected request. You can restore the previous behavior (and avoid
unexpected requests in tests), by using `$routeProvider.eagerInstantiationEnabled(false)`.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [e98656](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e9865654b39c71be71034c38581a8c7bd16bc716)**,
if a `redirectTo` function throws an Error, a `$routeChangeError` event will be fired. Previously,
execution would be aborted without firing a `$routeChangeError` event.

<hr />
<minor />
**Due to [7f4b35](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7f4b356c2bebb87f0c26b57a20415b004b20bcd1)**,
the `$route` service will no longer instantiate controllers nor call `resolve` or
`template`/`templateUrl` functions for routes that successfully `redirectTo` other routes.





## Migrating from 1.4 to 1.5

AngularJS 1.5 takes a big step towards preparing developers for a smoother transition to Angular in
the future. Architecting your applications using components, multi-slot transclusion, one-way
bindings in isolate scopes, using lifecycle hooks in directive controllers and relying on native ES6
features (such as classes and arrow functions) are now all possible with AngularJS 1.5.


This release includes numerous bug and security fixes, as well as performance improvements to core
services, directives, filters and helper functions. Existing applications can start enjoying the
benefits of such changes in `$compile`, `$parse`, `$animate`, `$animateCss`, `$sanitize`, `ngOptions`,
`currencyFilter`, `numberFilter`, `copy()` (to name but a few) without any change in code.

New features have been added to more than a dozen services, directives and filters across 8 modules.
Among them, a few stand out:

* `angular.component()`: Introducing "components", a special sort of directive that are easy to
  configure and promote best practices (plus can bring AngularJS applications closer to Angular's
  style of architecture).
* Multi-slot transclusion: Enabling the design of more powerful and complex UI elements with a much
  simpler configuration and reduced boilerplate.
* `$onInit` lifecycle hook: Introducing a new lifecycle hook for directive controllers, called after
  all required controllers have been constructed. This enables access to required controllers from
  a directive's controller, without having to rely on the linking function.
* `ngAnimateSwap`: A new directive in `ngAnimate`, making it super easy to create rotating
  banner-like components.
* Testing helpers: New helper functions in `ngMock`, simplifying testing for animations, component
  controllers and routing.

Also, notable is the improved support for ES6 features, such as classes and arrow functions. These
features are now more reliably detected and correctly handled within the core.


All this goodness doesn't come without a price, though. Below is a list of breaking changes (grouped
by module) that need to be taken into account while migrating from 1.4. Fortunately, the majority of
them should have a pretty low impact on most applications.


### Core

We tried to keep the breaking changes inside the core components to a bare minimum. Still, a few of
them were unavoidable.

#### Services (`$parse`)

Due to [0ea53503](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/0ea535035a3a1a992948490c3533bffb83235052),
a new special property, `$locals`, will be available for accessing the locals from an expression.
This is a breaking change, only if a `$locals` property does already exist (and needs to be
referenced) either on the `scope` or on the `locals` object. Your expressions should be changed to
access such existing properties as `this.$locals` and `$locals.$locals` respectively.


#### Directives (`ngOptions`)

A fair amount of work has been put into the `ngOptions` directive, fixing bugs and corner-cases and
neutralizing browser quirks. A couple of breaking changes were made in the process:

Due to [b71d7c3f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b71d7c3f3c04e65b02d88b33c22dd90ae3cdfc27),
falsy values (`''`, `0`, `false` and `null`) are properly recognized as option group identifiers for
options passed to `ngOptions`. Previously, all of these values were ignored and the option was not
assigned to any group. `undefined` is still interpreted as "no group".
If you have options with falsy group identifiers that should still not be assigned to any group,
then you must filter the values before passing them to `ngOptions`, converting falsy values to
`undefined`.

Due to [ded25187](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/ded2518756d4409fdfda0d4af243f2125bea01b5),
`ngOptions` now explicitly requires `ngModel` on the same element, thus an error will be thrown if
`ngModel` is not found. Previously, `ngOptions` would silently fail, which could lead to
hard-to-debug errors.
This is not expected to have any significant impact on applications, since `ngOptions` didn't work
without `ngModel` before either. The main difference is that now it will fail with a more
informative error message.


#### Filters (`orderBy`)

Due to [2a85a634](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/2a85a634f86c84f15b411ce009a3515fca7ba580),
passing a non-array-like value (other than `undefined` or `null`) through the `orderBy` filter will
throw an error. Previously, the input was returned unchanged, which could lead to hard-to-spot bugs
and was not consistent with other filters (e.g. `filter`).
Objects considered array-like include: arrays, array subclasses, strings, NodeLists,
jqLite/jQuery collections

#### Helper Functions:

The `angular.lowercase` and `angular.uppercase` functions have been **deprecated** and will be removed
in version 1.7.0. It is recommended to use [String.prototype.toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) and [String.prototype.toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) functions instead.


### ngAria

Due to [d06431e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/d06431e5309bb0125588877451dc79b935808134),
the `ngAria`-enhanced directives (e.g. `ngModel`, `ngDisabled` etc) will not apply ARIA attributes
to native inputs, unless necessary. Previously, ARIA attributes were always applied to native
inputs, despite this being unnecessary in most cases.
In the context of `ngAria`, elements considered "native inputs" include:
`<a>`, `<button>`, `<details>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<summary>`, `<textarea>`

This change will not affect the accessibility of your applications (since native inputs are
accessible by default), but if you relied on ARIA attributes being present on native inputs (for
whatever reason), you'll have to add and update them manually.

Additionally, the `aria-multiline` attribute, which was previously added to elements with a `type`
or `role` of `textbox`, will not be added anymore, since there is no way `ngAria` can tell if the
textbox element is multiline or not.
If you relied on `aria-multiline="true"` being automatically added by `ngAria`, you need to apply it
yourself. E.g. change your code from `<div role="textbox" ng-model="..." ...>` to
`<div role="textbox" ng-model="..." ... aria-multiline="true">`.


### ngMessages (`ngMessage`)

Due to [4971ef12](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/4971ef12d4c2c268cb8d26f90385dc96eba19db8),
the `ngMessage` directive is now compiled with a priority of 1, which means directives on the same
element as `ngMessage` with a priority lower than 1 will be applied when `ngMessage` calls its
`$transclude` function. Previously, they were applied during the initial compile phase and were
passed the comment element created by the transclusion of `ngMessage`.
If you have custom directives that relied on the previous behavior, you need to give them a priority
of 1 or greater.


### ngResource (`$resource`)

The `$resource` service underwent a minor internal refactoring to finally solve a long-standing bug
preventing requests from being cancelled using promises. Due to the nature of `$resource`'s
configuration, it was not possible to follow the `$http` convention. A new `$cancelRequest()` method
was introduced instead.

Due to [98528be3](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/98528be311b48269ba0e15ba4e3e2ad9b89693a9),
using a promise as `timeout` in `$resource` is no longer supported and will log a warning. This is
hardly expected to affect the behavior of your application, since a promise as `timeout` didn't work
before either, but it will now warn you explicitly when trying to pass one.
If you need to be able to cancel pending requests, you can now use the new `$cancelRequest()` that
will be available on `$resource` instances.


### ngRoute (`ngView`)

Due to [983b0598](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/983b0598121a8c5a3a51a30120e114d7e3085d4d),
a new property will be available on the scope of the route, allowing easy access to the route's
resolved values from the view's template. The default name for this property is `$resolve`. This is
a breaking change, only if a `$resolve` property is already available on the scope, in which case
the existing property will be hidden or overwritten.
To fix this, you should choose a custom name for this property, that does not collide with other
properties on the scope, by specifying the `resolveAs` property on the route.


### ngSanitize (`$sanitize`, `linky`)

The HTML sanitizer has been re-implemented using inert documents, increasing security, fixing some
corner-cases that were difficult to handle and reducing its size by about 20% (in terms of loc). In
order to make it more secure by default, a couple of breaking changes have been introduced:

Due to [181fc567](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/181fc567d873df065f1e84af7225deb70a8d2eb9),
SVG support in `$sanitize` is now an opt-in feature (i.e. disabled by default), as it could make
an application vulnerable to click-hijacking attacks. If your application relies on it, you can
still turn it on with `$sanitizeProvider.enableSvg(true)`, but you extra precautions need to be
taken in order to keep your application secure. Read the documentation for more information about
the dangers and ways to mitigate them.

Due to [7a668cdd](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7a668cdd7d08a7016883eb3c671cbcd586223ae8),
the `$sanitize` service will now remove instances of the `<use>` tag from the content passed to it.
This element is used to import external SVG resources, which is a security risk as the `$sanitize`
service does not have access to the resource in order to sanitize it.

Similarly, due to [234053fc](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/234053fc9ad90e0d05be7e8359c6af66be94c094),
the `$sanitize` service will now also remove instances of the `usemap` attribute from any elements
passed to it. This attribute is used to reference another element by `name` or `id`. Since the
`name` and `id` attributes are already banned, a sanitized `usemap` attribute could only
reference unsanitized content, which is a security risk.

Due to [98c2db7f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/98c2db7f9c2d078a408576e722407d518c7ee10a),
passing a non-string value (other than `undefined` or `null`) through the `linky` filter will throw
an error. This is not expected to have any significant impact on applications, since the input was
always assumed to be of type 'string', so passing non-string values never worked correctly anyway.
The main difference is that now it will fail faster and with a more informative error message.


### ngTouch (`ngClick`)

Due to [0dfc1dfe](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/0dfc1dfebf26af7f951f301c4e3848ac46f05d7f),
the `ngClick` override directive from the `ngTouch` module is **deprecated and disabled by default**.
This means that on touch-based devices, users might now experience a 300ms delay before a click
event is fired.

If you rely on this directive, you can still enable it using
`$touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled()`:

```js
angular.module('myApp').config(function($touchProvider) {
  $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled(true);
});
```

Going forward, we recommend using [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) or perhaps one of
the [AngularJS 3rd party touch-related modules](http://ngmodules.org/tags/touch) that provide similar
functionality.

Also note that modern browsers already remove the 300ms delay under some circumstances:

- **Chrome and Firefox for Android** remove the 300ms delay when the well-known
  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">` is set.
- **Internet Explorer** removes the delay, when the `touch-action` css property is set to `none` or
  `manipulation`.
- Since **iOS 8, Safari** removes the delay on so-called "slow taps".

For more info on the topic, you can take a look at this
[article by Telerik](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/).

  **Note:** This change does **not** affect the `ngSwipe` directive.

## Migrating from 1.3 to 1.4

AngularJS 1.4 fixes major animation issues and introduces a new API for `ngCookies`. Further, there
are changes to `ngMessages`, `$compile`, `ngRepeat`, `ngOptions`, `ngPattern`, `pattern` and some fixes to core filters:
`limitTo` and `filter`.

The reason for the ngAnimate refactor was to fix timing issues and to expose new APIs to allow
for developers to construct more versatile animations.  We now have access to `$animateCss`
and the many timing-oriented bugs were fixed which results in smoother animations.
If animation is something of interest, then please read over the breaking changes below for animations when
`ngAnimate` is used.

`ngMessages` has been upgraded to allow for dynamic message resolution. This handy feature allows for developers
to render error messages with ngMessages that are listed with a directive such as ngRepeat. A great usecase for this
involves pulling error message data from a server and then displaying that data via the mechanics of ngMessages. Be
sure to read the breaking change involved with `ngMessagesInclude` to upgrade your template code.

Other changes, such as the ordering of elements with ngRepeat and ngOptions and the way ngPattern and pattern directives
validate the regex, may also affect the behavior of your application. And be sure to also read up on the changes to `$cookies`.
The migration jump from 1.3 to 1.4 should be relatively straightforward otherwise.




### Animation (`ngAnimate`)

Animations in 1.4 have been refactored internally, but the API has stayed much the same. There are, however,
some breaking changes that need to be addressed when upgrading to 1.4.

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
JavaScript and CSS animations can no longer be run in
parallel. With earlier versions of ngAnimate, both CSS and JS animations
would be run together when multiple animations were detected. This
feature has been removed, however, the same effect, with even more
possibilities, can be achieved by injecting `$animateCss` into a
JavaScript-defined animation and creating custom CSS-based animations
from there.

By using `$animateCss` inside of a JavaScript animation in AngularJS 1.4, we can trigger custom CSS-based animations
directly from our JavaScript code.

```js
ngModule.animation('.slide-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
  return {
    enter: function(element, doneFn) {
      // this will trigger a `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active` CSS animation
      var animation = $animateCss(element, {
        event: 'enter'
        // any other CSS-related properties
        //   addClass: 'some-class',
        //   removeClass: 'some-other-class',
        //   from: {},
        //   to: {}
      });

      // make sure to read the ngAnimate docs to understand how this works
      animation.start().done(doneFn);
    }
  }
}]);
```

{@link ngAnimate.$animateCss Click here to learn how to use $animateCss in your animation code}

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
animation-related callbacks are now fired on `$animate.on` instead of directly being on the element.

```js
// < 1.4
element.on('$animate:before', function(e, data) {
  if (data.event === 'enter') { ... }
});
element.off('$animate:before', fn);

// 1.4+
$animate.on('enter', element, function(data) {
  //...
});
$animate.off('enter', element, fn);
```

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
the function params for `$animate.enabled()` when an element is used are now flipped. This fix allows
the function to act as a getter when a single element param is provided.

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enabled(false, element);

// 1.4+
$animate.enabled(element, false);
```

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
in addition to disabling the children of the element, `$animate.enabled(element, false)` will now also
disable animations on the element itself.

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
there is no need to call `$scope.$apply` or `$scope.$digest` inside of a animation promise callback anymore
since the promise is resolved within a digest automatically. (Not to worry, any extra digests will not be
run unless the promise is used.)

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.$apply(function() {
    $scope.explode = true;
  });
});

// 1.4+
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.explode = true;
});
```

Due to [c8700f04](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c8700f04fb6fb5dc21ac24de8665c0476d6db5ef),
when an enter, leave or move animation is triggered then it will always end any pending or active parent
class based animations (animations triggered via ngClass) in order to ensure that any CSS styles are resolved in time.




### Forms (`ngMessages`, `ngOptions`, `select`, `ngPattern` and `pattern`, `form`)

#### ngMessages
The ngMessages module has also been subject to an internal refactor to allow it to be more flexible
and compatible with dynamic message data. The `ngMessage` directive now supports a new attribute
called `ng-message-exp` which will evaluate an expression and will keep track of that expression
as it changes in order to re-evaluate the listed messages.

[Click here to learn more about dynamic ng-messages](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMessages#dynamic-messaging)

There is only one breaking change. Please consider the following when including remote
message templates via `ng-messages-include`:

Due to [c9a4421f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c9a4421fc3c97448527eadef1f42eb2f487ec2e0),
the `ngMessagesInclude` attribute has now been removed and cannot be used in the same element containing
the `ngMessages` directive. Instead, `ngMessagesInclude` is to be used on its own element inline with
other inline messages situated as children within the `ngMessages` container directive.

```html
<!-- AngularJS 1.3.x -->
<div ng-messages="model.$error" ng-messages-include="remote.html">
  <div ng-message="required">Your message is required</div>
</div>

<!-- AngularJS 1.4.x -->
<div ng-messages="model.$error">
  <div ng-message="required">Your message is required</div>
  <div ng-messages-include="remote.html"></div>
</div>
```

Depending on where the `ngMessagesInclude` directive is placed it will be prioritized inline with the other messages
before and after it.

Also due to [c9a4421f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c9a4421fc3c97448527eadef1f42eb2f487ec2e0),
it is no longer possible to use interpolation inside the `ngMessages` attribute expression. This technique
is generally not recommended, and can easily break when a directive implementation changes. In cases
where a simple expression is not possible, you can delegate accessing the object to a function:

```html
<div ng-messages="ctrl.form['field_{{$index}}'].$error">...</div>
```
would become
```html
<div ng-messages="ctrl.getMessages($index)">...</div>
```
where `ctrl.getMessages()`
```javascript
ctrl.getMessages = function($index) {
  return ctrl.form['field_' + $index].$error;
}
```

#### ngOptions

The `ngOptions` directive has also been refactored and as a result some long-standing bugs
have been fixed. The breaking changes are comparatively minor and should not affect most applications.

Due to [7fda214c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef),
when `ngOptions` renders the option values within the DOM, the resulting HTML code is different.
Normally this should not affect your application at all, however, if your code relies on inspecting
the value property of `<option>` elements (that `ngOptions` generates) then be sure
to [read the details](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef).

Due to [7fda214c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef),
when iterating over an object's properties using the `(key, value) in obj` syntax
the order of the elements used to be sorted alphabetically. This was an artificial
attempt to create a deterministic ordering since browsers don't guarantee the order.
But in practice this is not what people want and so this change iterates over properties
in the order they are returned by Object.keys(obj), which is almost always the order
in which the properties were defined.

Also due to [7fda214c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef),
setting the ngOptions attribute expression after the element is compiled, will no longer trigger the ngOptions behavior.
This worked previously because the ngOptions logic was part of the select directive, while
it is now implemented in the ngOptions directive itself.

#### select

Due to [7fda214c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef),
the `select` directive will now use strict comparison of the `ngModel` scope value against `option`
values to determine which option is selected. This means non-string scope values (such as `Number` or `Boolean`)
will not be matched against equivalent option strings (such as the strings `"123"`, `"true"` or `"false"`).

In AngularJS 1.3.x, setting `scope.x = 200` would select the option with the value 200 in the following `select`:

```
<select ng-model="x">
  <option value="100">100</option>
  <option value="200">200</option>
</select>
```

In AngularJS 1.4.x, the 'unknown option' will be selected.

To remedy this, you can initialize the model as a string: `scope.x = '200'`, or if you want to
keep the model as a `Number`, you can do the conversion via `$formatters` and `$parsers` on `ngModel`:

```js
ngModelCtrl.$parsers.push(function(value) {
  return parseInt(value, 10); // Convert option value to number
});

ngModelCtrl.$formatters.push(function(value) {
  return value.toString(); // Convert scope value to string
});
```

#### ngPattern and pattern

Due to [0e001084](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/0e001084ffff8674efad289d37cb16cc4e46b50a),
The `ngPattern` and `pattern` directives will validate the regex
against the `$viewValue` of `ngModel`, i.e. the value of the model
before the $parsers are applied. Previously, the `$modelValue`
(the result of the $parsers) was validated.

This fixes issues where `input[date]` and `input[number]` cannot
be validated because the `$viewValue` string is parsed into
`Date` and `Number` respectively (starting with AngularJS 1.3).
It also brings the directives in line with HTML5 constraint
validation, which validates against the input value.

This change is unlikely to cause applications to fail, because even
in AngularJS 1.2, the value that was validated by pattern could have
been manipulated by the $parsers, as all validation was done
inside this pipeline.

If you rely on the pattern being validated against the `$modelValue`,
you must create your own validator directive that overwrites
the built-in pattern validator:

```
.directive('patternModelOverwrite', function patternModelOverwriteDirective() {
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    require: '?ngModel',
    priority: 1,
    compile: function() {
      var regexp, patternExp;

      return {
        pre: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          attr.$observe('pattern', function(regex) {
            /**
             * The built-in directive will call our overwritten validator
             * (see below). We just need to update the regex.
             * The preLink fn guaranetees our observer is called first.
             */
            if (isString(regex) && regex.length > 0) {
              regex = new RegExp('^' + regex + '$');
            }

            if (regex && !regex.test) {
              //The built-in validator will throw at this point
              return;
            }

            regexp = regex || undefined;
          });

        },
        post: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          regexp, patternExp = attr.ngPattern || attr.pattern;

          //The postLink fn guarantees we overwrite the built-in pattern validator
          ctrl.$validators.pattern = function(value) {
            return ctrl.$isEmpty(value) ||
              isUndefined(regexp) ||
              regexp.test(value);
          };
        }
      };
    }
  };
});
```


#### form

Due to [94533e57](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/94533e570673e6b2eb92073955541fa289aabe02),
the `name` attribute of `form` elements can now only contain characters that can be evaluated as part
of an AngularJS expression. This is because AngularJS uses the value of `name` as an assignable expression
to set the form on the `$scope`. For example, `name="myForm"` assigns the form to `$scope.myForm` and
`name="myObj.myForm"` assigns it to `$scope.myObj.myForm`.

Previously, it was possible to also use names such `name="my:name"`, because AngularJS used a special setter
function for the form name. Now the general, more robust `$parse` setter is used.

The easiest way to migrate your code is therefore to remove all special characters from the `name` attribute.

If you need to keep the special characters, you can use the following directive, which will replace
the `name` with a value that can be evaluated as an expression in the compile function, and then
re-set the original name in the postLink function. This ensures that (1), the form is published on
the scope, and (2), the form has the original name, which might be important if you are doing server-side
form submission.

```js
angular.module('myApp').directive('form', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    priority: 1000,
    compile: function(element, attrs) {
      var unsupportedCharacter = ':'; // change accordingly
      var originalName = attrs.name;
      if (attrs.name && attrs.name.indexOf(unsupportedCharacter) > 0) {
        attrs.$set('name', 'this["' + originalName + '"]');
      }

      return postLinkFunction(scope, element) {
        // Don't trigger $observers
        element.setAttribute('name', originalName);
      }
    }
  };
});
```

### Templating (`ngRepeat`, `$compile`, `ngInclude`)

#### ngRepeat

Due to [c260e738](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c260e7386391877625eda086480de73e8a0ba921),
previously, the order of items when using ngRepeat to iterate over object properties was guaranteed to be consistent
by sorting the keys into alphabetic order.

Now, the order of the items is browser dependent based on the order returned
from iterating over the object using the `for key in obj` syntax.

It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions
when keys are deleted and reinstated. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues

The best approach is to convert Objects into Arrays by a filter such as
https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter
or some other mechanism, and then sort them manually in the order you need.


#### $compile

Due to [6a38dbfd](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6a38dbfd3c34c8f9efff503d17eb3cbeb666d422),
previously, '&' expressions would always set up a function in the isolate scope. Now, if the binding
is marked as optional and the attribute is not specified, no function will be added to the isolate scope.

Due to [62d514b](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/62d514b06937cc7dd86e973ea11165c88343b42d),
returning an object from a controller constructor function will now override the scope. Views that use the
controllerAs method will no longer get the this reference, but the returned object.

#### ngInclude
Due to [3c6e8ce044446735eb2e70d0061db8c6db050289](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3c6e8ce044446735eb2e70d0061db8c6db050289), the `src` attribute of ngInclude no longer accepts an
expression that returns the result of `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl`. This will now cause an infinite digest:

Before:
```html
<div ng-include="findTemplate('https://example.com/templates/myTemplate.html')"></div>
```

```js
$scope.findTemplate = function(templateName) {
  return $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(templateName);
};
```

To migrate, either cache the result of `trustAsResourceUrl()`, or put the template url in the trusted resource
URL list in the `config()` function:

After:

```js
var templateCache = {};
$scope.findTemplate = function(templateName) {
  if (!templateCache[templateName]) {
    templateCache[templateName] = $sce.trustAsResourceUrl(templateName);
  }

  return templateCache[templateName];
};

// Alternatively, use `$sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist()` (called
// `trustedResourceUrlList()` from 1.8.1 onwards), which means you don't
// have to use `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl()` at all:

angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {
  $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist(['self', 'https://example.com/templates/**'])
});
```


### Cookies (`ngCookies`)

Due to [38fbe3ee](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/38fbe3ee8370fc449b82d80df07b5c2ed2cd5fbe),
`$cookies` will no longer expose properties that represent the current browser cookie
values. `$cookies` no longer polls the browser for changes to the cookies and ***no longer copies
cookie values onto the `$cookies` object***.

This was changed because the polling is expensive and caused issues with the `$cookies` properties
not synchronizing correctly with the actual browser cookie values (The reason the polling
was originally added was to allow communication between different tabs,
but there are better ways to do this today, for example `localStorage`.)

The new API on `$cookies` is as follows:

 * `get`
 * `put`
 * `getObject`
 * `putObject`
 * `getAll`
 * `remove`

You must explicitly use the methods above in order to access cookie data. This also means that
you can no longer watch the properties on `$cookies` to detect changes
that occur on the browsers cookies.

This feature is generally only needed if a 3rd party library was programmatically
changing the cookies at runtime. If you rely on this then you must either write code that
can react to the 3rd party library making the changes to cookies or implement your own polling
mechanism.

**DEPRECATION NOTICE**

`$cookieStore` is now deprecated as all the useful logic
has been moved to `$cookies`, to which `$cookieStore` now simply
delegates calls.


### Server Requests (`$http`)

Due to [5da1256](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/5da1256fc2812d5b28fb0af0de81256054856369),
`transformRequest` functions can no longer modify request headers.

Before this commit `transformRequest` could modify request headers, ex.:

```javascript
function requestTransform(data, headers) {
    headers = angular.extend(headers(), {
      'X-MY_HEADER': 'abcd'
    });
  }
  return angular.toJson(data);
}
```

This behavior was unintended and undocumented, so the change should affect very few applications. If one
needs to dynamically add / remove headers it should be done in a header function, for example:

```javascript
$http.get(url, {
  headers: {
    'X-MY_HEADER': function(config) {
      return 'abcd'; //you've got access to a request config object to specify header value dynamically
    }
  }
})
```


### Filters (`filter`, `limitTo`)

#### `filter` filter
Due to [cea8e751](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/cea8e75144e6910b806b63a6ec2a6d118316fddd),
the `filter` filter will throw an error when used with a non-array. Beforehand it would silently
return an empty array.

If necessary, this can be worked around by converting an object to an array,
using a filter such as https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter.

#### `limitTo` filter
Due to [a3c3bf33](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a3c3bf3332e5685dc319c46faef882cb6ac246e1),
the limitTo filter has changed behavior when the provided limit value is invalid.
Now, instead of returning empty object/array, it returns unchanged input.




## Migrating from 1.2 to 1.3

### Controllers

Due to [3f2232b5](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3f2232b5a181512fac23775b1df4a6ebda67d018),
`$controller` will no longer look for controllers on `window`.
The old behavior of looking on `window` for controllers was originally intended
for use in examples, demos, and toy apps. We found that allowing global controller
functions encouraged poor practices, so we resolved to disable this behavior by
default.

To migrate, register your controllers with modules rather than exposing them
as globals:

Before:

```javascript
function MyController() {
  // ...
}
```

After:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MyController', [function() {
  // ...
}]);
```

Although it's not recommended, you can re-enable the old behavior like this:

```javascript
angular.module('myModule').config(['$controllerProvider', function($controllerProvider) {
  // this option might be handy for migrating old apps, but please don't use it
  // in new ones!
  $controllerProvider.allowGlobals();
}]);
```

### AngularJS Expression Parsing (`$parse` + `$interpolate`)

- due to [77ada4c8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/77ada4c82d6b8fc6d977c26f3cdb48c2f5fbe5a5),

You can no longer invoke .bind, .call or .apply on a function in AngularJS expressions.
This is to disallow changing the behaviour of existing functions
in an unforeseen fashion.

  - due to [6081f207](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6081f20769e64a800ee8075c168412b21f026d99),

The (deprecated) __proto__ property does not work inside AngularJS expressions
anymore.


- due to [48fa3aad](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/48fa3aadd546036c7e69f71046f659ab1de244c6),

This prevents the use of __{define,lookup}{Getter,Setter}__ inside AngularJS
expressions. If you really need them for some reason, please wrap/bind them to make them
less dangerous, then make them available through the scope object.


- due to [528be29d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/528be29d1662122a34e204dd607e1c0bd9c16bbc),

This prevents the use of `Object` inside AngularJS expressions.
If you need Object.keys, make it accessible in the scope.


- due to [bdfc9c02](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/bdfc9c02d021e08babfbc966a007c71b4946d69d),
  values 'f', '0', 'false', 'no', 'n', '[]' are no longer
treated as falsy. Only JavaScript falsy values are now treated as falsy by the
expression parser; there are six of them: false, null, undefined, NaN, 0 and "".


- due to [fa6e411d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/fa6e411da26824a5bae55f37ce7dbb859653276d),
  promise unwrapping has been removed. It has been deprecated since 1.2.0-rc.3.
  It can no longer be turned on.
  Two methods have been removed:
  * `$parseProvider.unwrapPromises`
  * `$parseProvider.logPromiseWarnings`


- **$interpolate:** due to [88c2193c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/88c2193c71954b9e7e7e4bdf636a2b168d36300d),
  the function returned by `$interpolate`
  no longer has a `.parts` array set on it.

  Instead it has two arrays:
  * `.expressions`, an array of the expressions in the
    interpolated text. The expressions are parsed with
    `$parse`, with an extra layer converting them to strings
    when computed
  * `.separators`, an array of strings representing the
    separations between interpolations in the text.
    This array is **always** 1 item longer than the
    `.expressions` array for easy merging with it




### Miscellaneous AngularJS helpers

- **Angular.copy:** due to [b59b04f9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b59b04f98a0b59eead53f6a53391ce1bbcbe9b57),

This changes `angular.copy` so that it applies the prototype of the original
object to the copied object.  Previously, `angular.copy` would copy properties
of the original object's prototype chain directly onto the copied object.

This means that if you iterate over only the copied object's `hasOwnProperty`
properties, it will no longer contain the properties from the prototype.
This is actually much more reasonable behaviour and it is unlikely that
applications are actually relying on this.

If this behaviour is relied upon, in an app, then one should simply iterate
over all the properties on the object (and its inherited properties) and
not filter them with `hasOwnProperty`.

**Be aware that this change also uses a feature that is not compatible with
IE8.**  If you need this to work on IE8 then you would need to provide a polyfill
for `Object.create` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`.


- **forEach:** due to [55991e33](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/55991e33af6fece07ea347a059da061b76fc95f5),
  forEach will iterate only over the initial number of items in
the array. So if items are added to the array during the iteration, these won't
be iterated over during the initial forEach call.

This change also makes our forEach behave more like Array#forEach.


- **angular.toJson:** due to [c054288c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c054288c9722875e3595e6e6162193e0fb67a251),
  `toJson()` will no longer strip properties starting with a single `$`. If you relied on
`toJson()`'s stripping these types of properties before, you will have to do it manually now.
It will still strip properties starting with `$$` though.




### jqLite / JQuery

- **jqLite:** due to [a196c8bc](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a196c8bca82a28c08896d31f1863cf4ecd11401c),
  previously it was possible to set jqLite data on Text/Comment
nodes, but now that is allowed only on Element and Document nodes just like in
jQuery. We don't expect that app code actually depends on this accidental feature.


- **jqLite:** due to [d71dbb1a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/d71dbb1ae50f174680533492ce4c7db3ff74df00),
  the jQuery `detach()` method does not trigger the `$destroy` event.
  If you want to destroy AngularJS data attached to the element, use `remove()`.





### AngularJS HTML Compiler (`$compile`)


- due to [2ee29c5d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/2ee29c5da81ffacdc1cabb438f5d125d5e116cb9),

The isolated scope of a component directive no longer leaks into the template
that contains the instance of the directive.  This means that you can no longer
access the isolated scope from attributes on the element where the isolated
directive is defined.

See https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/10236 for an example.

- due to [2cde927e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/2cde927e58c8d1588569d94a797e43cdfbcedaf9),


Requesting isolate scope and any other scope on a single element is an error.
Before this change, the compiler let two directives request a child scope
and an isolate scope if the compiler applied them in the order of non-isolate
scope directive followed by isolate scope directive.

Now the compiler will error regardless of the order.

If you find that your code is now throwing a `$compile:multidir` error,
check that you do not have directives on the same element that are trying
to request both an isolate and a non-isolate scope and fix your code.


- due to [eec6394a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/eec6394a342fb92fba5270eee11c83f1d895e9fb), The `replace` flag for defining directives that
  replace the element that they are on will be removed in the next major AngularJS version.
  This feature has difficult semantics (e.g. how attributes are merged) and leads to more
  problems compared to what it solves. Also, with Web Components it is normal to have
  custom elements in the DOM.


- due to [299b220f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/299b220f5e05e1d4e26bfd58d0b2fd7329ca76b1),
  calling `attr.$observe` no longer returns the observer function, but a
    deregistration function instead. To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = attr.$observe('someAttr', function(value) {
            console.log(value);
          });
        }
      };
    });

After:

    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = function(value) {
            console.log(value);
          };

          attr.$observe('someAttr', observer);
        }
      };
    });

  - due to [531a8de7](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/531a8de72c439d8ddd064874bf364c00cedabb11),
`$observe` no longer registers on undefined attributes. For example, if you were using `$observe` on
an absent optional attribute to set a default value, the following would not work anymore:

```html
<my-dir></my-dir>
```

```js
// Link function for directive myDir
link: function(scope, element, attr) {
  attr.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
    scope.myValue = newVal ? newVal : 'myDefaultValue';
  })
}
```

Instead, check if the attribute is set before registering the observer:

```js
link: function(scope, element, attr) {
  if (attr.myAttr) {
    // register the observer
  } else {
    // set the default
  }
}
```





### Forms, Inputs and ngModel

- due to [1be9bb9d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1be9bb9d3527e0758350c4f7417a4228d8571440),


If an expression is used on ng-pattern (such as `ng-pattern="exp"`) or on the
pattern attribute (something like on `pattern="{{ exp }}"`) and the expression
itself evaluates to a string then the validator will not parse the string as a
literal regular expression object (a value like `/abc/i`).  Instead, the entire
string will be created as the regular expression to test against. This means
that any expression flags will not be placed on the RegExp object. To get around
this limitation, use a regular expression object as the value for the expression.

    //before
    $scope.exp = '/abc/i';

    //after
    $scope.exp = /abc/i;


- **ngModelOptions:** due to [adfc322b](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/adfc322b04a58158fb9697e5b99aab9ca63c80bb),


This commit changes the API on `NgModelController`, both semantically and
in terms of adding and renaming methods.

* `$setViewValue(value)` -
This method still changes the `$viewValue` but does not immediately commit this
change through to the `$modelValue` as it did previously.
Now the value is committed only when a trigger specified in an associated
`ngModelOptions` directive occurs. If `ngModelOptions` also has a `debounce` delay
specified for the trigger then the change will also be debounced before being
committed.
In most cases this should not have a significant impact on how `NgModelController`
is used: If `updateOn` includes `default` then `$setViewValue` will trigger
a (potentially debounced) commit immediately.
* `$cancelUpdate()` - is renamed to `$rollbackViewValue()` and has the same meaning,
which is to revert the current `$viewValue` back to the `$lastCommittedViewValue`,
to cancel any pending debounced updates and to re-render the input.

To migrate code that used `$cancelUpdate()` follow the example below:

Before:

```js
$scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 27) {
    $scope.myForm.myInput1.$cancelUpdate();
    $scope.myValue = '';
  }
};
```

After:

```js
$scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
  if (e.keyCode === 27) {
    $scope.myForm.myInput1.$rollbackViewValue();
    $scope.myValue = '';
  }
}
```

- types date, time, datetime-local, month, week now always
  require a `Date` object as model ([46bd6dc8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/46bd6dc88de252886d75426efc2ce8107a5134e9),
   [#5864](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5864))


- {@link input[checkbox] `input[checkbox]`} now supports constant expressions in `ngTrueValue` and
  `ngFalseValue`, making it now possible to e.g. use boolean and integer values. Previously, these attributes would
  always be treated as strings, whereas they are now parsed as expressions, and will throw if an expression
  is non-constant. To convert non-constant strings into constant expressions, simply wrap them in an
  extra pair of quotes, like so:

    `<input type="checkbox" ng-model="..." ng-true-value="'truthyValue'">`

  See [c90cefe1614](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c90cefe16142d973a123e945fc9058e8a874c357)


### Scopes and Digests (`$scope`)

- due to [8c6a8171](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/8c6a8171f9bdaa5cdabc0cc3f7d3ce10af7b434d),
  Scope#$id is now of type number rather than string. Since the
id is primarily being used for debugging purposes this change should not affect
anyone.


- due to [82f45aee](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/82f45aee5bd84d1cc53fb2e8f645d2263cdaacbc),
  [#7445](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7445),
  [#7523](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/7523)
  `$broadcast` and `$emit` will now reset the `currentScope` property of the event to
  null once the event finished propagating. If any code depends on asynchronously accessing their
  `currentScope` property, it should be migrated to use `targetScope` instead. All of these cases
  should be considered programming bugs.





### Server Requests (`$http`, `$resource`)
- **$http:** due to [ad4336f9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/ad4336f9359a073e272930f8f9bcd36587a8648f),


Previously, it was possible to register a response interceptor like so:

```js
// register the interceptor as a service
$provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
  return function(promise) {
    return promise.then(function(response) {
      // do something on success
      return response;
    }, function(response) {
      // do something on error
      if (canRecover(response)) {
        return responseOrNewPromise
      }
      return $q.reject(response);
    });
  }
});

$httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
```

Now, one must use the newer API introduced in v1.1.4 (4ae46814), like so:

```js
$provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q) {
  return {
    response: function(response) {
      // do something on success
      return response;
    },
    responseError: function(response) {
      // do something on error
      if (canRecover(response)) {
        return responseOrNewPromise
      }
      return $q.reject(response);
    }
  };
});

$httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
```

More details on the new interceptors API (which has been around as of v1.1.4) can be found at
{@link $http#interceptors interceptors}



- **$httpBackend:** due to [6680b7b9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6680b7b97c0326a80bdccaf0a35031e4af641e0e), the JSONP behavior for erroneous and empty responses changed:
    Previously, a JSONP response was regarded as erroneous if it was empty. Now AngularJS is listening to the
    correct events to detect errors, i.e. even empty responses can be successful.


- **$resource:** due to [d3c50c84](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/d3c50c845671f0f8bcc3f7842df9e2fb1d1b1c40),

  If you expected `$resource` to strip these types of properties before,
  you will have to manually do this yourself now.





### Modules and Injector (`$inject`)

- due to [c0b4e2db](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c0b4e2db9cbc8bc3164cedc4646145d3ab72536e),

Previously, config blocks would be able to control behaviour of provider registration, due to being
invoked prior to provider registration. Now, provider registration always occurs prior to configuration
for a given module, and therefore config blocks are not able to have any control over a providers
registration.

**Example**:

Previously, the following:

```js
angular.module('foo', [])
  .provider('$rootProvider', function() {
    this.$get = function() { ... }
  })
  .config(function($rootProvider) {
    $rootProvider.dependentMode = "B";
  })
  .provider('$dependentProvider', function($rootProvider) {
     if ($rootProvider.dependentMode === "A") {
       this.$get = function() {
        // Special mode!
       }
     } else {
       this.$get = function() {
         // something else
       }
    }
  });
```

would have "worked", meaning behaviour of the config block between the registration of "$rootProvider"
and "$dependentProvider" would have actually accomplished something and changed the behaviour of the
app. This is no longer possible within a single module.


### Filters (`orderBy`)

- due to [a097aa95](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/a097aa95b7c78beab6d1b7d521c25f7d9d7843d9),
  `orderBy` now treats `null` values (which in JavaScript have type `object`) as having a string
  representation of `'null'`.


### Animation (`ngAnimate`)


- due to [1cb8584e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1cb8584e8490ecdb1b410a8846c4478c6c2c0e53),
`$animate` will no longer default the after parameter to the last element of the parent
container. Instead, when after is not specified, the new element will be inserted as the
first child of the parent container.

To update existing code, change all instances of `$animate.enter()` or `$animate.move()` from:

`$animate.enter(element, parent);`

to:

`$animate.enter(element, parent, angular.element(parent[0].lastChild));`



- due to [1bebe36a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1bebe36aa938890d61188762ed618b1b5e193634),

  Any class-based animation code that makes use of transitions
and uses the setup CSS classes (such as class-add and class-remove) must now
provide an empty transition value to ensure that its styling is applied right
away. In other words if your animation code is expecting any styling to be
applied that is defined in the setup class then it will not be applied
"instantly" unless a `transition:0s none` value is present in the styling
for that CSS class. This situation is only the case if a transition is already
present on the base CSS class once the animation kicks off.

Before:

    .animated.my-class-add {
      opacity:0;
      transition:0.5s linear all;
    }
    .animated.my-class-add.my-class-add-active {
      opacity:1;
    }

After:

    .animated.my-class-add {
      transition:0s linear all;
      opacity:0;
    }
    .animated.my-class-add.my-class-add-active {
      transition:0.5s linear all;
      opacity:1;
    }

Please view the documentation for ngAnimate for more info.


### Testing

- due to [85880a64](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/85880a64900fa22a61feb926bf52de0965332ca5), some deprecated features of
Protractor tests no longer work.

`by.binding(descriptor)` no longer allows using the surrounding interpolation
markers in the descriptor (the default interpolation markers are `{{}}`).
Previously, these were optional.

Before:

    var el = element(by.binding('{{foo}}'));

After:

    var el = element(by.binding('foo'));

Prefixes `ng_` and `x-ng-` are no longer allowed for models. Use `ng-model`.

`by.repeater` cannot find elements by row and column which are not children of
the row. For example, if your template is

    <div ng-repeat="foo in foos">{{foo.name}}</div>

Before:

    var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2).column('foo.name'))

After:

You may either enclose `{{foo.name}}` in a child element

    <div ng-repeat="foo in foos"><span>{{foo.name}}</span></div>

or simply use:

    var el = element(by.repeater('foo in foos').row(2))


### Internet Explorer 8

- due to [eaa1d00b](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/eaa1d00b24008f590b95ad099241b4003688cdda),
  As communicated before, IE8 is no longer supported.

### ngRoute has been moved into its own module

Just like `ngResource`, `ngRoute` is now its own module.

Applications that use `$route`, `ngView`, and/or `$routeParams` will now need to load an
`angular-route.js` file and have their application's module dependency on the `ngRoute` module.

Before:

```html
<script src="angular.js"></script>
```

```javascript
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['someOtherModule']);
```

After:

```html
<script src="angular.js"></script>
<script src="angular-route.js"></script>
```

```javascript
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute', 'someOtherModule']);
```

See [5599b55b](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/5599b55b04788c2e327d7551a4a699d75516dd21).


### Templates no longer automatically unwrap promises

`$parse` and templates in general will no longer automatically unwrap promises.

Before:

```javascript
$scope.foo = $http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl'});
```

```html
<p>{{foo}}</p>
```

After:

```javascript
$http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl'})
  .success(function(data) {
    $scope.foo = data;
  });
```

```html
<p>{{foo}}</p>
```

This feature has been deprecated. If absolutely needed, it can be reenabled for now via the
`$parseProvider.unwrapPromises(true)` API.

See [5dc35b52](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/5dc35b527b3c99f6544b8cb52e93c6510d3ac577),
[b6a37d11](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b6a37d112b3e1478f4d14a5f82faabf700443748).


### Syntax for named wildcard parameters changed in `$route`

To migrate the code, follow the example below. Here, `*highlight` becomes `:highlight*`

Before:

```javascript
$routeProvider.when('/Book1/:book/Chapter/:chapter/*highlight/edit',
          {controller: noop, templateUrl: 'Chapter.html'});
```

After:

```javascript
$routeProvider.when('/Book1/:book/Chapter/:chapter/:highlight*/edit',
        {controller: noop, templateUrl: 'Chapter.html'});
```

See [04cebcc1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/04cebcc133c8b433a3ac5f72ed19f3631778142b).


### You can only bind one expression to `*[src]`, `*[ng-src]` or `action`

With the exception of `<a>` and `<img>` elements, you cannot bind more than one expression to the
`src` or `action` attribute of elements.

This is one of several improvements to security introduces by AngularJS 1.2.

Concatenating expressions makes it hard to understand whether some combination of concatenated
values are unsafe to use and potentially subject to XSS vulnerabilities. To simplify the task of
auditing for XSS issues, we now require that a single expression be used for `*[src/ng-src]`
bindings such as bindings for `iframe[src]`, `object[src]`, etc. In addition, this requirement is
enforced for `form` tags with `action` attributes.

<table class="table table-bordered code-table">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><code>&lt;img src="{{a}}/{{b}}"&gt;</code></td>
  <td class="success">ok</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>&lt;iframe src="{{a}}/{{b}}"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></td>
  <td class="error">bad</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><code>&lt;iframe src="{{a}}"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></td>
  <td class="success">ok</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


To migrate your code, you can combine multiple expressions using a method attached to your scope.

Before:

```javascript
scope.baseUrl = 'page';
scope.a = 1;
scope.b = 2;
```

```html
<!-- Are a and b properly escaped here? Is baseUrl controlled by user? -->
<iframe src="{{baseUrl}}?a={{a}&b={{b}}">
```

After:

```javascript
var baseUrl = "page";
scope.getIframeSrc = function() {

  // One should think about their particular case and sanitize accordingly
  var qs = ["a", "b"].map(function(value, name) {
      return encodeURIComponent(name) + "=" +
             encodeURIComponent(value);
    }).join("&");

  // `baseUrl` isn't exposed to a user's control, so we don't have to worry about escaping it.
  return baseUrl + "?" + qs;
};
```

```html
<iframe src="{{getIframeSrc()}}">
```

See [38deedd6](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/38deedd6e3d806eb8262bb43f26d47245f6c2739).


### Interpolations inside DOM event handlers are now disallowed

DOM event handlers execute arbitrary JavaScript code. Using an interpolation for such handlers
means that the interpolated value is a JS string that is evaluated. Storing or generating such
strings is error prone and leads to XSS vulnerabilities. On the other hand, `ngClick` and other
AngularJS specific event handlers evaluate AngularJS expressions in non-window (Scope) context which
makes them much safer.

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

```
JS:   scope.foo = 'alert(1)';
HTML: <div onclick="{{foo}}">
```

After:

```
JS:   scope.foo = function() { alert(1); }
HTML: <div ng-click="foo()">
```

See [39841f2e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/39841f2ec9b17b3b2920fd1eb548d444251f4f56).


### Directives cannot end with -start or -end

This change was necessary to enable multi-element directives. The best fix is to rename existing
directives so that they don't end with these suffixes.

See [e46100f7](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e46100f7097d9a8f174bdb9e15d4c6098395c3f2).


### In $q, promise.always has been renamed promise.finally

The reason for this change is to align `$q` with the [Q promise
library](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), despite the fact that this makes it a bit more difficult
to use with non-ES5 browsers, like IE8.

`finally` also goes well together with the `catch` API that was added to `$q` recently and is part
of the [DOM promises standard](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

To migrate the code follow the example below.

Before:

```javascript
$http.get('/foo').always(doSomething);
```

After:

```javascript
$http.get('/foo').finally(doSomething);
```

Or for IE8-compatible code:

```javascript
$http.get('/foo')['finally'](doSomething);
```

See [f078762d](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/f078762d48d0d5d9796dcdf2cb0241198677582c).


### ngMobile is now ngTouch

Many touch-enabled devices are not mobile devices, so we decided to rename this module to better
reflect its concerns.

To migrate, replace all references to `ngMobile` with `ngTouch` and `angular-mobile.js` with
`angular-touch.js`.

See [94ec84e7](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/94ec84e7b9c89358dc00e4039009af9e287bbd05).


### resource.$then has been removed

Resource instances do not have a `$then` function anymore. Use the `$promise.then` instead.

Before:

```javascript
Resource.query().$then(callback);
```

After:

```javascript
Resource.query().$promise.then(callback);
```

See [05772e15](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/05772e15fbecfdc63d4977e2e8839d8b95d6a92d).


### Resource methods return the promise

Methods of a resource instance return the promise rather than the instance itself.

Before:

```javascript
resource.$save().chaining = true;
```

After:

```javascript
resource.$save();
resource.chaining = true;
```

See [05772e15](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/05772e15fbecfdc63d4977e2e8839d8b95d6a92d).


### Resource promises are resolved with the resource instance

On success, the resource promise is resolved with the resource instance rather than HTTP response object.

Use interceptor API to access the HTTP response object.

Before:

```javascript
Resource.query().$then(function(response) {...});
```

After:

```javascript
var Resource = $resource('/url', {}, {
  get: {
    method: 'get',
    interceptor: {
      response: function(response) {
        // expose response
        return response;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

See [05772e15](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/05772e15fbecfdc63d4977e2e8839d8b95d6a92d).


### $location.search supports multiple keys

{@link ng.$location#search `$location.search`} now supports multiple keys with the
same value provided that the values are stored in an array.

Before this change:

* `parseKeyValue` only took the last key overwriting all the previous keys.
* `toKeyValue` joined the keys together in a comma delimited string.

This was deemed buggy behavior. If your server relied on this behavior then either the server
should be fixed, or a simple serialization of the array should be done on the client before
passing it to `$location`.

See [80739409](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/807394095b991357225a03d5fed81fea5c9a1abe).


### ngBindHtmlUnsafe has been removed and replaced by ngBindHtml

`ngBindHtml` provides `ngBindHtmlUnsafe` like
behavior (evaluate an expression and innerHTML the result into the DOM) when bound to the result
of `$sce.trustAsHtml(string)`. When bound to a plain string, the string is sanitized via
`$sanitize` before being innerHTML'd. If the `$sanitize` service isn't available (`ngSanitize`
module is not loaded) and the bound expression evaluates to a value that is not trusted an
exception is thrown.

When using this directive you can either include `ngSanitize` in your module's dependencies (See the
example at the {@link ngBindHtml} reference) or use the {@link $sce} service to set the value as
trusted.

See [dae69473](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/dae694739b9581bea5dbc53522ec00d87b26ae55).


### Form names that are expressions are evaluated

If you have form names that will evaluate as an expression:

```
<form name="ctrl.form">
```

And if you are accessing the form from your controller:

Before:

```javascript
function($scope) {
  $scope['ctrl.form'] // form controller instance
}
```

After:

```javascript
function($scope) {
  $scope.ctrl.form // form controller instance
}
```

This makes it possible to access a form from a controller using the new "controller as" syntax.
Supporting the previous behavior offers no benefit.

See [8ea802a1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/8ea802a1d23ad8ecacab892a3a451a308d9c39d7).


### hasOwnProperty disallowed as an input name

Inputs with name equal to `hasOwnProperty` are not allowed inside form or ngForm directives.

Before, inputs whose name was "hasOwnProperty" were quietly ignored and not added to the scope.
Now a badname exception is thrown. Using "hasOwnProperty" for an input name would be very unusual
and bad practice. To migrate, change your input name.

See [7a586e5c](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7a586e5c19f3d1ecc3fefef084ce992072ee7f60).


### Directives: Order of postLink functions reversed

The order of postLink fn is now mirror opposite of the order in which corresponding preLinking and compile functions execute.

Previously the compile/link fns executed in order, sorted by priority:

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped code-table">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>#</th>
  <th>Step</th>
  <th align="center">Old Sort Order</th>
  <th align="center">New Sort Order</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Compile Fns</td>
  <td align="center" colspan="2">High → Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td colspan="3">Compile child nodes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>PreLink Fns</td>
  <td align="center" colspan="2">High → Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td colspan="3">Link child nodes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>5</td>
  <td>PostLink Fns</td>
  <td align="center">High → Low</td>
  <td align="center">**Low → High**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<small>"High → Low" here refers to the `priority` option of a directive.</small>

Very few directives in practice rely on the order of postLinking functions (unlike on the order
of compile functions), so in the rare case of this change affecting an existing directive, it might
be necessary to convert it to a preLinking function or give it negative priority.

You can look at [the diff of this
commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/31f190d4d53921d32253ba80d9ebe57d6c1de82b) to see how an internal
attribute interpolation directive was adjusted.

See [31f190d4](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/31f190d4d53921d32253ba80d9ebe57d6c1de82b).


### Directive priority

the priority of ngRepeat, ngSwitchWhen, ngIf, ngInclude and ngView has changed. This could affect directives that explicitly specify their priority.

In order to make ngRepeat, ngSwitchWhen, ngIf, ngInclude and ngView work together in all common scenarios their directives are being adjusted to achieve the following precedence:


Directive        | Old Priority | New Priority
-----------------|--------------|-------------
ngRepeat         | 1000         | 1000
ngSwitchWhen     | 500          | 800
ngIf             | 1000         | 600
ngInclude        | 1000         | 400
ngView           | 1000         | 400

See [b7af76b4](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b7af76b4c5aa77648cc1bfd49935b48583419023).


### ngScenario

browserTrigger now uses an eventData object instead of direct parameters for mouse events.
To migrate, place the `keys`,`x` and `y` parameters inside of an object and place that as the
third parameter for the browserTrigger function.

See [28f56a38](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/28f56a383e9d1ff378e3568a3039e941c7ffb1d8).


### ngInclude and ngView replace its entire element on update

Previously `ngInclude` and `ngView` only updated its element's content. Now these directives will
recreate the element every time a new content is included.

This ensures that a single rootElement for all the included contents always exists, which makes
definition of css styles for animations much easier.

See [7d69d52a](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7d69d52acff8578e0f7d6fe57a6c45561a05b182),
[aa2133ad](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/aa2133ad818d2e5c27cbd3933061797096356c8a).


### URLs are now sanitized against a trusted URI matcher

A trusted URI matcher configured via `$compileProvider` can be used to configure what URLs are considered safe.
By default all common protocol prefixes are trusted including `data:` URIs with mime types `image/*`.
This change shouldn't impact apps that don't contain malicious image links.

See [1adf29af](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1adf29af13890d61286840177607edd552a9df97),
[3e39ac7e](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3e39ac7e1b10d4812a44dad2f959a93361cd823b).


### Isolate scope only exposed to directives with `scope` property

If you declare a scope option on a directive, that directive will have an
[isolate scope](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes). In AngularJS 1.0, if a
directive with an isolate scope is used on an element, all directives on that same element have access
to the same isolate scope. For example, say we have the following directives:

```
// This directive declares an isolate scope.
.directive('isolateScope', function() {
  return {
    scope: {},
    link: function($scope) {
      console.log('one = ' + $scope.$id);
    }
  };
})

// This directive does not.
.directive('nonIsolateScope', function() {
  return {
    link: function($scope) {
      console.log('two = ' + $scope.$id);
    }
  };
});
```

Now what happens if we use both directives on the same element?

```
<div isolate-scope non-isolate-scope></div>
```

In AngularJS 1.0, the nonIsolateScope directive will have access to the isolateScope directive’s scope. The
log statements will print the same id, because the scope is the same. But in AngularJS 1.2, the nonIsolateScope
will not use the same scope as isolateScope. Instead, it will inherit the parent scope. The log statements
will print different id’s.

If your code depends on the AngularJS 1.0 behavior (non-isolate directive needs to access state
from within the isolate scope), change the isolate directive to use scope locals to pass these explicitly:

**Before**

```
<input ng-model="$parent.value" ng-isolate>

.directive('ngIsolate', function() {
  return {
    scope: {},
    template: '{{value}}'
  };
});
```

**After**

```
<input ng-model="value" ng-isolate>

.directive('ngIsolate', function() {
  return {
    scope: {value: '=ngModel'},
    template: '{{value}}
  };
});
```

See [909cabd3](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/909cabd36d779598763cc358979ecd85bb40d4d7),
[#1924](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1924) and
[#2500](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/2500).


### Change to interpolation priority

Previously, the interpolation priority was `-100` in 1.2.0-rc.2, and `100` before 1.2.0-rc.2.
Before this change the binding was setup in the post-linking phase.

Now the attribute interpolation (binding) executes as a directive with priority 100 and the
binding is set up in the pre-linking phase.

See [79223eae](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/79223eae5022838893342c42dacad5eca83fabe8),
[#4525](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4525),
[#4528](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4528), and
[#4649](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4649)

### Underscore-prefixed/suffixed properties are non-bindable

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>**Reverted**: This breaking change has been reverted in 1.2.1, and so can be ignored if you're using **version 1.2.1 or higher**</p>
</div>

This change introduces the notion of "private" properties (properties
whose names begin and/or end with an underscore) on the scope chain.
These properties will not be available to AngularJS expressions (i.e. {{
}} interpolation in templates and strings passed to `$parse`)  They are
freely available to JavaScript code (as before).

**Motivation**

AngularJS expressions execute in a limited context. They do not have
direct access to the global scope, `window`, `document` or the Function
constructor. However, they have direct access to names/properties on
the scope chain. It has been a long standing best practice to keep
sensitive APIs outside of the scope chain (in a closure or your
controller.) That's easier said than done for two reasons:

1. JavaScript does not have a notion of private properties so if you need
someone on the scope chain for JavaScript use, you also expose it to
AngularJS expressions
2. The new `controller as` syntax that's now in increased usage exposes the
entire controller on the scope chain greatly increasing the exposed surface.

Though AngularJS expressions are written and controlled by the developer, they:

1. Typically deal with user input
2. Don't get the kind of test coverage that JavaScript code would

This commit provides a way, via a naming convention, to allow restricting properties from
controllers/scopes. This means AngularJS expressions can access only those properties that
are actually needed by the expressions.

See [3d6a89e8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3d6a89e8888b14ae5cb5640464e12b7811853c7e).


### You cannot bind to select[multiple]

Switching between `select[single]` and `select[multiple]` has always been odd due to browser quirks.
This feature never worked with two-way data-binding so it's not expected that anyone is using it.

If you are interested in properly adding this feature, please submit a pull request on Github.

See [d87fa004](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/d87fa0042375b025b98c40bff05e5f42c00af114).


### Uncommon region-specific local files were removed from i18n

AngularJS uses the Google Closure library's locale files. The following locales were removed from
Closure, so AngularJS is not able to continue to support them:

`chr`, `cy`, `el-polyton`, `en-zz`, `fr-rw`, `fr-sn`, `fr-td`, `fr-tg`, `haw`, `it-ch`, `ln-cg`,
`mo`, `ms-bn`, `nl-aw`, `nl-be`, `pt-ao`, `pt-gw`, `pt-mz`, `pt-st`, `ro-md`, `ru-md`, `ru-ua`,
`sr-cyrl-ba`, `sr-cyrl-me`, `sr-cyrl`, `sr-latn-ba`, `sr-latn-me`, `sr-latn`, `sr-rs`, `sv-fi`,
`sw-ke`, `ta-lk`, `tl-ph`, `ur-in`, `zh-hans-hk`, `zh-hans-mo`, `zh-hans-sg`, `zh-hans`,
`zh-hant-hk`, `zh-hant-mo`, `zh-hant-tw`, `zh-hant`

Although these locales were removed from the official AngularJS repository, you can continue to
load and use your copy of the locale file provided that you maintain it yourself.

See [6382e21f](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6382e21fb28541a2484ac1a241d41cf9fbbe9d2c).

### Services can now return functions

Previously, the service constructor only returned objects regardless of whether a function was returned.

Now, `$injector.instantiate` (and thus `$provide.service`) behaves the same as the native
`new` operator and allows functions to be returned as a service.

If using a JavaScript preprocessor it's quite possible when upgrading that services could start behaving incorrectly.
Make sure your services return the correct type wanted.

**Coffeescript example**

```
myApp.service 'applicationSrvc', ->
  @something = "value"
  @someFunct = ->
    "something else"
```

pre 1.2 this service would return the whole object as the service.

post 1.2 this service returns `someFunct` as the value of the service

you would need to change this services to

```
myApp.service 'applicationSrvc', ->
  @something = "value"
  @someFunct = ->
    "something else"
  return
```

to continue to return the complete instance.

See [c22adbf1](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/c22adbf160f32c1839fbb35382b7a8c6bcec2927).

# Modules

## What is a Module?

You can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app – controllers,
services, filters, directives, etc.

## Why?

Most applications have a main method that instantiates and wires together the different parts of
the application.

AngularJS apps don't have a main method. Instead modules declaratively specify how an application
should be bootstrapped. There are several advantages to this approach:

  * The declarative process is easier to understand.
  * You can package code as reusable modules.
  * The modules can be loaded in any order (or even in parallel) because modules delay execution.
  * Unit tests only have to load relevant modules, which keeps them fast.
  * End-to-end tests can use modules to override configuration.


## The Basics

I'm in a hurry. How do I get a Hello World module working?

<example ng-app-included="true" name="module-hello-world">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-app="myApp">
      <div>
        {{ 'World' | greet }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    // declare a module
    var myAppModule = angular.module('myApp', []);

    // configure the module.
    // in this example we will create a greeting filter
    myAppModule.filter('greet', function() {
     return function(name) {
        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
      };
    });
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should add Hello to the name', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding("'World' | greet")).getText()).toEqual('Hello, World!');
    });
  </file>
</example>

Important things to notice:

  * The {@link angular.Module Module} API
  * The reference to `myApp` module in `<div ng-app="myApp">`.
    This is what bootstraps the app using your module.
  * The empty array in `angular.module('myApp', [])`.
    This array is the list of modules `myApp` depends on.


## Recommended Setup

While the example above is simple, it will not scale to large applications. Instead we recommend
that you break your application to multiple modules like this:

  * A module for each feature
  * A module for each reusable component (especially directives and filters)
  * And an application level module which depends on the above modules and contains any
    initialization code.

You can find a community [style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) to help
yourself when application grows.

The above is a suggestion. Tailor it to your needs.

<example module='xmpl' name="module-suggested-layout">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="XmplController">
      {{ greeting }}
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('xmpl.service', [])

      .value('greeter', {
        salutation: 'Hello',
        localize: function(localization) {
          this.salutation = localization.salutation;
        },
        greet: function(name) {
          return this.salutation + ' ' + name + '!';
        }
      })

      .value('user', {
        load: function(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      });

    angular.module('xmpl.directive', []);

    angular.module('xmpl.filter', []);

    angular.module('xmpl', ['xmpl.service', 'xmpl.directive', 'xmpl.filter'])

      .run(function(greeter, user) {
        // This is effectively part of the main method initialization code
        greeter.localize({
          salutation: 'Bonjour'
        });
        user.load('World');
      })

      .controller('XmplController', function($scope, greeter, user) {
        $scope.greeting = greeter.greet(user.name);
      });

  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should add Hello to the name', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding("greeting")).getText()).toEqual('Bonjour World!');
    });
  </file>

</example>



## Module Loading

A {@link angular.Module module} is a collection of providers, services, directives etc.,
and optionally config and run blocks which get applied to the application during the
bootstrap process.

The {@link angular.Module module API} describes all the available methods and how they can be used.

See {@link guide/di#using-dependency-injection Using Dependency Injection} to find out which
dependencies can be injected in each method.

### Dependencies and Order of execution

Modules can list other modules as their dependencies. Depending on a module implies that the required
module will be loaded before the requiring module is loaded.

In a single module the order of execution is as follows:

1. {@link angular.Module#provider provider} functions are executed, so they and the services they
define can be made available to the {@link auto.$injector $injector}.

2. After that, the configuration blocks ({@link angular.Module#config config} functions) are executed.
This means the configuration blocks of the required modules execute before the configuration blocks
of any requiring module.

This continues until all module dependencies has been resolved.

Then, the {@link angular.Module#run run} blocks that have been collected from each module are
executed in order of requirement.

Note: each module is only loaded once, even if multiple other modules require it.
Note: the factory function for "values" and "services" is called lazily when the value/service is
injected for the first time.

### Registration in the config block

While it is recommended to register injectables directly with the {@link angular.Module module API},
it is also possible to register services, directives etc. by injecting
{@link $provide $provide} or the individual service providers into the config function:


```js
angular.module('myModule', []).
  value('a', 123).
  factory('a', function() { return 123; }).
  directive('directiveName', ...).
  filter('filterName', ...);

// is same as

angular.module('myModule', []).
  config(function($provide, $compileProvider, $filterProvider) {
    $provide.value('a', 123);
    $provide.factory('a', function() { return 123; });
    $compileProvider.directive('directiveName', ...);
    $filterProvider.register('filterName', ...);
  });
```

### Run Blocks

Run blocks are the closest thing in AngularJS to the main method. A run block is the code which
needs to run to kickstart the application. It is executed after all of the services have been
configured and the injector has been created. Run blocks typically contain code which is hard
to unit-test, and for this reason should be declared in isolated modules, so that they can be
ignored in the unit-tests.

### Asynchronous Loading

Modules are a way of managing $injector configuration, and have nothing to do with loading of
scripts into a VM. There are existing projects which deal with script loading, which may be used
with AngularJS. Because modules do nothing at load time they can be loaded into the VM in any order
and thus script loaders can take advantage of this property and parallelize the loading process.

### Creation versus Retrieval

Beware that using `angular.module('myModule', [])` will create the module `myModule` and overwrite any
existing module named `myModule`. Use `angular.module('myModule')` to retrieve an existing module.

```js
var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);

// add some directives and services
myModule.service('myService', ...);
myModule.directive('myDirective', ...);

// overwrites both myService and myDirective by creating a new module
var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);

// throws an error because myOtherModule has yet to be defined
var myModule = angular.module('myOtherModule');
```

## Unit Testing

A unit test is a way of instantiating a subset of an application to apply stimulus to it.
Small, structured modules help keep unit tests concise and focused.

<div class="did you know...">
Each module can only be loaded once per injector.
Usually an AngularJS app has only one injector and modules are only loaded once.
Each test has its own injector and modules are loaded multiple times.
</div>

In all of these examples we are going to assume this module definition:

```js
angular.module('greetMod', []).

  factory('alert', function($window) {
    return function(text) {
      $window.alert(text);
    }
  }).

  value('salutation', 'Hello').

  factory('greet', function(alert, salutation) {
    return function(name) {
      alert(salutation + ' ' + name + '!');
    }
  });
```

Let's write some tests to show how to override configuration in tests.

```js
describe('myApp', function() {
  // load application module (`greetMod`) then load a special
  // test module which overrides `$window` with a mock version,
  // so that calling `window.alert()` will not block the test
  // runner with a real alert box.
  beforeEach(module('greetMod', function($provide) {
    $provide.value('$window', {
      alert: jasmine.createSpy('alert')
    });
  }));

  // inject() will create the injector and inject the `greet` and
  // `$window` into the tests.
  it('should alert on $window', inject(function(greet, $window) {
    greet('World');
    expect($window.alert).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello World!');
  }));

  // this is another way of overriding configuration in the
  // tests using inline `module` and `inject` methods.
  it('should alert using the alert service', function() {
    var alertSpy = jasmine.createSpy('alert');
    module(function($provide) {
      $provide.value('alert', alertSpy);
    });
    inject(function(greet) {
      greet('World');
      expect(alertSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Hello World!');
    });
  });
});
```

# Running an AngularJS App in Production

There are a few things you might consider when running your AngularJS application in production.


## Disabling Debug Data

By default AngularJS attaches information about binding and scopes to DOM nodes,
and adds CSS classes to data-bound elements:

- As a result of `ngBind`, `ngBindHtml` or `{{...}}` interpolations, binding data and CSS class
`ng-binding` are attached to the corresponding element.

- Where the compiler has created a new scope, the scope and either `ng-scope` or `ng-isolated-scope`
CSS class are attached to the corresponding element. These scope references can then be accessed via
`element.scope()` and `element.isolateScope()`.

- Placeholder comments for structural directives will contain information about what directive
and binding caused the placeholder. E.g. `<!-- ngIf: shouldShow() -->`.

Tools like [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) and
[Batarang](https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang) need this information to run,
but you can disable this in production for a significant performance boost with:

```js
myApp.config(['$compileProvider', function ($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
}]);
```

If you wish to debug an application with this information then you should open up a debug
console in the browser then call this method directly in this console:

```js
angular.reloadWithDebugInfo();
```

The page should reload and the debug information should now be available.

For more see the docs pages on {@link ng.$compileProvider#debugInfoEnabled `$compileProvider`}
and {@link angular.reloadWithDebugInfo `angular.reloadWithDebugInfo`}.

## Strict DI Mode

Using strict di mode in your production application will throw errors when an injectable
function is not
{@link di#dependency-annotation annotated explicitly}. Strict di mode is intended to help
you make sure that your code will work when minified. However, it also will force you to
make sure that your injectable functions are explicitly annotated which will improve
angular's performance when injecting dependencies in your injectable functions because it
doesn't have to dynamically discover a function's dependencies. It is recommended to
automate the explicit annotation via a tool like
[ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) when you deploy to production (and enable
strict di mode)

To enable strict di mode, you have two options:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-strict-di>
  <!-- your app here -->
</div>
```

or

```js
angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp'], {
  strictDi: true
});
```

For more information, see the
{@link di#using-strict-dependency-injection DI Guide}.


## Disable comment and css class directives

By default AngularJS compiles and executes all directives inside comments and element classes.
In order to perform this task, the AngularJS compiler must look for directives by:

- Parse all your application element classes.

- Parse all your application html comments.

Nowadays most of the AngularJS projects are using only element and attribute directives,
and in such projects there is no need to compile comments and classes.

If you are sure that your project only uses element and attribute directives,
and you are not using any 3rd party library that uses
directives inside element classes or html comments,
you can disable the compilation of directives on element classes and comments
for the whole application.
This results in a compilation performance gain,
as the compiler does not have to check comments and element classes looking for directives.

To disable comment and css class directives use the `$compileProvider`:

```
$compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled(false);
$compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled(false);
```

For more see the docs pages on
{@link ng.$compileProvider#commentDirectivesEnabled `$compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled`}
and
{@link ng.$compileProvider#cssClassDirectivesEnabled `$compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled`}.

## guide/providers.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name  Providers
@sortOrder 340
@description

# Providers

Each web application you build is composed of objects that collaborate to get stuff done. These
objects need to be instantiated and wired together for the app to work. In AngularJS apps most of
these objects are instantiated and wired together automatically by the {@link auto.$injector
injector service}.

The injector creates two types of objects, **services** and **specialized objects**.

Services are objects whose API is defined by the developer writing the service.

Specialized objects conform to a specific AngularJS framework API. These objects are one of
controllers, directives, filters or animations.

The injector needs to know how to create these objects. You tell it by registering a "recipe" for
creating your object with the injector. There are five recipe types.

The most verbose, but also the most comprehensive one is a Provider recipe. The remaining four
recipe types — Value, Factory, Service and Constant — are just syntactic sugar on top of a provider
recipe.

Let's take a look at the different scenarios for creating and using services via various recipe
types. We'll start with the simplest case possible where various places in your code need a shared
string and we'll accomplish this via Value recipe.


## Note:  A Word on Modules

In order for the injector to know how to create and wire together all of these objects, it needs
a registry of "recipes". Each recipe has an identifier of the object and the description of how to
create this object.

Each recipe belongs to an {@link angular.Module AngularJS module}. An AngularJS module is a bag
that holds one or more recipes. And since manually keeping track of module dependencies is no fun,
a module can contain information about dependencies on other modules as well.

When an AngularJS application starts with a given application module, AngularJS creates a new instance
of injector, which in turn creates a registry of recipes as a union of all recipes defined in the
core "ng" module, application module and its dependencies. The injector then consults the recipe
registry when it needs to create an object for your application.


## Value Recipe

Let's say that we want to have a very simple service called "clientId" that provides a string
representing an authentication id used for some remote API. You would define it like this:

```javascript
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);
myApp.value('clientId', 'a12345654321x');
```

Notice how we created an AngularJS module called `myApp`, and specified that this module definition
contains a "recipe" for constructing the `clientId` service, which is a simple string in this case.

And this is how you would display it via AngularJS's data-binding:


```javascript
myApp.controller('DemoController', ['clientId', function DemoController(clientId) {
  this.clientId = clientId;
}]);
```

```html
<html ng-app="myApp">
  <body ng-controller="DemoController as demo">
    Client ID: {{demo.clientId}}
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we've used the Value recipe to define the value to provide when `DemoController`
asks for the service with id "clientId".

On to more complex examples!


## Factory Recipe

The Value recipe is very simple to write, but lacks some important features we often need when
creating services.  Let's now look at the Value recipe's more powerful sibling, the Factory. The
Factory recipe adds the following abilities:

* ability to use other services (have dependencies)
* service initialization
* delayed/lazy initialization

The Factory recipe constructs a new service using a function with zero or more arguments (these
are dependencies on other services). The return value of this function is the service instance
created by this recipe.

Note: All services in AngularJS are singletons. That means that the injector uses each recipe at most
once to create the object. The injector then caches the reference for all future needs.

Since a Factory is a more powerful version of the Value recipe, the same service can be constructed with it.
Using our previous `clientId` Value recipe example, we can rewrite it as a Factory recipe like this:

```javascript
myApp.factory('clientId', function clientIdFactory() {
  return 'a12345654321x';
});
```

But given that the token is just a string literal, sticking with the Value recipe is still more
appropriate as it makes the code easier to follow.

Let's say, however, that we would also like to create a service that computes a token used for
authentication against a remote API. This token will be called `apiToken` and will be computed
based on the `clientId` value and a secret stored in the browser's local storage:

```javascript
myApp.factory('apiToken', ['clientId', function apiTokenFactory(clientId) {
  var encrypt = function(data1, data2) {
    // NSA-proof encryption algorithm:
    return (data1 + ':' + data2).toUpperCase();
  };

  var secret = window.localStorage.getItem('myApp.secret');
  var apiToken = encrypt(clientId, secret);

  return apiToken;
}]);
```

In the code above, we see how the `apiToken` service is defined via the Factory recipe that depends
on the `clientId` service. The factory service then uses NSA-proof encryption to produce an authentication
token.

<div class="alert alert-success">
**Best Practice:** name the factory functions as `<serviceId>Factory`
(e.g., apiTokenFactory). While this naming convention is not required, it helps when navigating the codebase
or looking at stack traces in the debugger.
</div>

Just like with the Value recipe, the Factory recipe can create a service of any type, whether it be a
primitive, object literal, function, or even an instance of a custom type.


## Service Recipe

JavaScript developers often use custom types to write object-oriented code. Let's explore how we
could launch a unicorn into space via our `unicornLauncher` service which is an instance of a
custom type:

```javascript
function UnicornLauncher(apiToken) {

  this.launchedCount = 0;
  this.launch = function() {
    // Make a request to the remote API and include the apiToken
    ...
    this.launchedCount++;
  }
}
```

We are now ready to launch unicorns, but notice that UnicornLauncher depends on our `apiToken`.
We can satisfy this dependency on `apiToken` using the Factory recipe:

```javascript
myApp.factory('unicornLauncher', ["apiToken", function(apiToken) {
  return new UnicornLauncher(apiToken);
}]);
```


This is, however, exactly the use-case that the Service recipe is the most suitable for.

The Service recipe produces a service just like the Value or Factory recipes, but it does so by
*invoking a constructor with the `new` operator*. The constructor can take zero or more arguments,
which represent dependencies needed by the instance of this type.

Note: Service recipes follow a design pattern called [constructor
injection](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#ConstructorInjectionWithPicocontainer).

Since we already have a constructor for our UnicornLauncher type, we can replace the Factory recipe
above with a Service recipe like this:

```javascript
myApp.service('unicornLauncher', ["apiToken", UnicornLauncher]);
```

Much simpler!

## Provider Recipe

As already mentioned in the intro, the Provider recipe is the core recipe type and
all the other recipe types are just syntactic sugar on top of it. It is the most verbose recipe
with the most abilities, but for most services it's overkill.

The Provider recipe is syntactically defined as a custom type that implements a `$get` method. This
method is a factory function just like the one we use in the Factory recipe. In fact, if you define
a Factory recipe, an empty Provider type with the `$get` method set to your factory function is
automatically created under the hood.

You should use the Provider recipe only when you want to expose an API for application-wide
configuration that must be made before the application starts. This is usually interesting only
for reusable services whose behavior might need to vary slightly between applications.

Let's say that our `unicornLauncher` service is so awesome that many apps use it. By default the
launcher shoots unicorns into space without any protective shielding. But on some planets the
atmosphere is so thick that we must wrap every unicorn in tinfoil before sending it on its
intergalactic trip, otherwise they would burn while passing through the atmosphere. It would then
be great if we could configure the launcher to use the tinfoil shielding for each launch in apps
that need it. We can make it configurable like so:


```javascript
myApp.provider('unicornLauncher', function UnicornLauncherProvider() {
  var useTinfoilShielding = false;

  this.useTinfoilShielding = function(value) {
    useTinfoilShielding = !!value;
  };

  this.$get = ["apiToken", function unicornLauncherFactory(apiToken) {

    // let's assume that the UnicornLauncher constructor was also changed to
    // accept and use the useTinfoilShielding argument
    return new UnicornLauncher(apiToken, useTinfoilShielding);
  }];
});
```

To turn the tinfoil shielding on in our app, we need to create a config function via the module
API and have the UnicornLauncherProvider injected into it:

```javascript
myApp.config(["unicornLauncherProvider", function(unicornLauncherProvider) {
  unicornLauncherProvider.useTinfoilShielding(true);
}]);
```

Notice that the unicorn provider is injected into the config function. This injection is done by a
provider injector which is different from the regular instance injector, in that it instantiates
and wires (injects) all provider instances only.

During application bootstrap, before AngularJS goes off creating all services, it configures and
instantiates all providers. We call this the configuration phase of the application life-cycle.
During this phase, services aren't accessible because they haven't been created yet.

Once the configuration phase is over, interaction with providers is disallowed and the process of
creating services starts. We call this part of the application life-cycle the run phase.


## Constant Recipe

We've just learned how AngularJS splits the life-cycle into configuration phase and run phase and how
you can provide configuration to your application via the config function. Since the config
function runs in the configuration phase when no services are available, it doesn't have access
even to simple value objects created via the Value recipe.

Since simple values, like URL prefixes, don't have dependencies or configuration, it's often handy
to make them available in both the configuration and run phases. This is what the Constant recipe
is for.

Let's say that our `unicornLauncher` service can stamp a unicorn with the planet name it's being
launched from if this name was provided during the configuration phase. The planet name is
application specific and is used also by various controllers during the runtime of the application.
We can then define the planet name as a constant like this:

```javascript
myApp.constant('planetName', 'Greasy Giant');
```

We could then configure the unicornLauncherProvider like this:

```javascript
myApp.config(['unicornLauncherProvider', 'planetName', function(unicornLauncherProvider, planetName) {
  unicornLauncherProvider.useTinfoilShielding(true);
  unicornLauncherProvider.stampText(planetName);
}]);
```

And since Constant recipe makes the value also available at runtime just like the Value recipe, we
can also use it in our controller and template:

```javascript
myApp.controller('DemoController', ["clientId", "planetName", function DemoController(clientId, planetName) {
  this.clientId = clientId;
  this.planetName = planetName;
}]);
```

```html
<html ng-app="myApp">
  <body ng-controller="DemoController as demo">
   Client ID: {{demo.clientId}}
   <br>
   Planet Name: {{demo.planetName}}
  </body>
</html>
```


## Special Purpose Objects

Earlier we mentioned that we also have special purpose objects that are different from services.
These objects extend the framework as plugins and therefore must implement interfaces specified by
AngularJS. These interfaces are Controller, Directive, Filter and Animation.

The instructions for the injector to create these special objects (with the exception of the
Controller objects) use the Factory recipe behind the scenes.

Let's take a look at how we would create a very simple component via the directive api that depends
on the `planetName` constant we've just defined and displays the planet name, in our case:
"Planet Name: Greasy Giant".

Since the directives are registered via the Factory recipe, we can use the same syntax as with factories.

```javascript
myApp.directive('myPlanet', ['planetName', function myPlanetDirectiveFactory(planetName) {
  // directive definition object
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    scope: {},
    link: function($scope, $element) { $element.text('Planet: ' + planetName); }
  }
}]);
```

We can then use the component like this:

```html
<html ng-app="myApp">
  <body>
   <my-planet></my-planet>
  </body>
</html>
```

Using Factory recipes, you can also define AngularJS's filters and animations, but the controllers
are a bit special. You create a controller as a custom type that declares its dependencies as
arguments for its constructor function. This constructor is then registered with a module. Let's
take a look at the `DemoController`, created in one of the early examples:

```javascript
myApp.controller('DemoController', ['clientId', function DemoController(clientId) {
  this.clientId = clientId;
}]);
```

The DemoController is instantiated via its constructor, every time the app needs an instance of
DemoController (in our simple app it's just once). So unlike services, controllers are not
singletons. The constructor is called with all the requested services, in our case the `clientId`
service.


## Conclusion

To wrap it up, let's summarize the most important points:

- The injector uses recipes to create two types of objects: services and special purpose objects
- There are five recipe types that define how to create objects: Value, Factory, Service, Provider
  and Constant.
- Factory and Service are the most commonly used recipes. The only difference between them is that
  the Service recipe works better for objects of a custom type, while the Factory can produce JavaScript
  primitives and functions.
- The Provider recipe is the core recipe type and all the other ones are just syntactic sugar on it.
- Provider is the most complex recipe type. You don't need it unless you are building a reusable
  piece of code that needs global configuration.
- All special purpose objects except for the Controller are defined via Factory recipes.

## guide/scope.ngdoc

@ngdoc overview
@name  Scopes
@sortOrder 240
@description

# What are Scopes?

{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} is an object that refers to the application
model. It is an execution context for {@link expression expressions}. Scopes are
arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. Scopes can
watch {@link guide/expression expressions} and propagate events.

## Scope characteristics

  - Scopes provide APIs ({@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch}) to observe
    model mutations.

  - Scopes provide APIs ({@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply}) to
    propagate any model changes through the system into the view from outside of the "AngularJS
    realm" (controllers, services, AngularJS event handlers).

  - Scopes can be nested to limit access to the properties of application components while providing
    access to shared model properties. Nested scopes are either "child scopes" or "isolate scopes".
    A "child scope" (prototypically) inherits properties from its parent scope. An "isolate scope"
    does not. See {@link
    guide/directive#isolating-the-scope-of-a-directive isolated
    scopes} for more information.

  - Scopes provide context against which {@link guide/expression expressions} are evaluated. For
    example `{{username}}` expression is meaningless, unless it is evaluated against a specific
    scope which defines the `username` property.

## Scope as Data-Model

Scope is the glue between application controller and the view. During the template {@link compiler
linking} phase the {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives} set up
{@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`} expressions on the scope. The
`$watch` allows the directives to be notified of property changes, which allows the directive to
render the updated value to the DOM.

Both controllers and directives have reference to the scope, but not to each other. This
arrangement isolates the controller from the directive as well as from the DOM. This is an important
point since it makes the controllers view agnostic, which greatly improves the testing story of
the applications.

<example module="scopeExample" name="scope-data-model">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('scopeExample', [])
      .controller('MyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.username = 'World';

        $scope.sayHello = function() {
          $scope.greeting = 'Hello ' + $scope.username + '!';
        };
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="MyController">
      Your name:
        <input type="text" ng-model="username">
        <button ng-click='sayHello()'>greet</button>
      <hr>
      {{greeting}}
    </div>
  </file>
</example>

In the above example notice that the `MyController` assigns `World` to the `username` property of
the scope. The scope then notifies the `input` of the assignment, which then renders the input
with username pre-filled. This demonstrates how a controller can write data into the scope.

Similarly the controller can assign behavior to scope as seen by the `sayHello` method, which is
invoked when the user clicks on the 'greet' button. The `sayHello` method can read the `username`
property and create a `greeting` property. This demonstrates that the properties on scope update
automatically when they are bound to HTML input widgets.

Logically the rendering of `{{greeting}}` involves:

  * retrieval of the scope associated with DOM node where `{{greeting}}` is defined in template.
    In this example this is the same scope as the scope which was passed into `MyController`. (We
    will discuss scope hierarchies later.)

  * Evaluate the `greeting` {@link guide/expression expression} against the scope retrieved above,
    and assign the result to the text of the enclosing DOM element.


You can think of the scope and its properties as the data which is used to render the view. The
scope is the single source-of-truth for all things view related.

From a testability point of view, the separation of the controller and the view is desirable, because it allows us
to test the behavior without being distracted by the rendering details.

```js
  it('should say hello', function() {
    var scopeMock = {};
    var cntl = new MyController(scopeMock);

    // Assert that username is pre-filled
    expect(scopeMock.username).toEqual('World');

    // Assert that we read new username and greet
    scopeMock.username = 'angular';
    scopeMock.sayHello();
    expect(scopeMock.greeting).toEqual('Hello angular!');
  });
```


## Scope Hierarchies

Each AngularJS application has exactly one {@link ng.$rootScope root scope}, but
may have any number of child scopes.

The application can have multiple scopes, because {@link guide/directive directives} can create new
child scopes. When new scopes are created, they are added as children of their parent scope. This
creates a tree structure which parallels the DOM where they're attached.

The section {@link guide/scope#directives-that-create-scopes Directives that Create Scopes} has more
info about which directives create scopes.

When AngularJS evaluates `{{name}}`, it first looks at the scope associated with the given
element for the `name` property. If no such property is found, it searches the parent scope
and so on until the root scope is reached. In JavaScript this behavior is known as prototypical
inheritance, and child scopes prototypically inherit from their parents.

This example illustrates scopes in application, and prototypical inheritance of properties. The example is followed by
a diagram depicting the scope boundaries.

<example module="scopeExample" name="scope-hierarchies">
  <file name="index.html">
  <div class="show-scope-demo">
    <div ng-controller="GreetController">
      Hello {{name}}!
    </div>
    <div ng-controller="ListController">
      <ol>
        <li ng-repeat="name in names">{{name}} from {{department}}</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>
  </file>
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('scopeExample', [])
      .controller('GreetController', ['$scope', '$rootScope', function($scope, $rootScope) {
        $scope.name = 'World';
        $rootScope.department = 'AngularJS';
      }])
      .controller('ListController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.names = ['Igor', 'Misko', 'Vojta'];
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="style.css">
    .show-scope-demo.ng-scope,
    .show-scope-demo .ng-scope  {
      border: 1px solid red;
      margin: 3px;
    }
  </file>
</example>

<img class="center" src="img/guide/concepts-scope.png">

Notice that AngularJS automatically places `ng-scope` class on elements where scopes are
attached. The `<style>` definition in this example highlights in red the new scope locations. The
child scopes are necessary because the repeater evaluates `{{name}}` expression, but
depending on which scope the expression is evaluated it produces different result. Similarly the
evaluation of `{{department}}` prototypically inherits from root scope, as it is the only place
where the `department` property is defined.


## Retrieving Scopes from the DOM.

Scopes are attached to the DOM as `$scope` data property, and can be retrieved for debugging
purposes. (It is unlikely that one would need to retrieve scopes in this way inside the
application.) The location where the root scope is attached to the DOM is defined by the location
of {@link ng.directive:ngApp `ng-app`} directive. Typically
`ng-app` is placed on the `<html>` element, but it can be placed on other elements as well, if,
for example, only a portion of the view needs to be controlled by AngularJS.

To examine the scope in the debugger:

  1. Right click on the element of interest in your browser and select 'inspect element'. You
  should see the browser debugger with the element you clicked on highlighted.

  2. The debugger allows you to access the currently selected element in the console as `$0`
    variable.

  3. To retrieve the associated scope in console execute: `angular.element($0).scope()`

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  The `scope()` function is only available when {@link ng.$compileProvider#debugInfoEnabled `$compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled()`} is true (which is the default).
</div>

## Scope Events Propagation

Scopes can propagate events in similar fashion to DOM events. The event can be {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope#$broadcast broadcasted} to the scope children or {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope#$emit emitted} to scope parents.

<example module="eventExample" name="scope-events-propagation">
  <file name="script.js">
    angular.module('eventExample', [])
      .controller('EventController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
        $scope.count = 0;
        $scope.$on('MyEvent', function() {
          $scope.count++;
        });
      }]);
  </file>
  <file name="index.html">
    <div ng-controller="EventController">
      Root scope <tt>MyEvent</tt> count: {{count}}
      <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="i in [1]" ng-controller="EventController">
          <button ng-click="$emit('MyEvent')">$emit('MyEvent')</button>
          <button ng-click="$broadcast('MyEvent')">$broadcast('MyEvent')</button>
          <br>
          Middle scope <tt>MyEvent</tt> count: {{count}}
          <ul>
            <li ng-repeat="item in [1, 2]" ng-controller="EventController">
              Leaf scope <tt>MyEvent</tt> count: {{count}}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </file>
</example>



## Scope Life Cycle

The normal flow of a browser receiving an event is that it executes a corresponding JavaScript
callback. Once the callback completes the browser re-renders the DOM and returns to waiting for
more events.

When the browser calls into JavaScript the code executes outside the AngularJS execution context,
which means that AngularJS is unaware of model modifications. To properly process model
modifications the execution has to enter the AngularJS execution context using the {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply `$apply`} method. Only model modifications which
execute inside the `$apply` method will be properly accounted for by AngularJS. For example if a
directive listens on DOM events, such as {@link
ng.directive:ngClick `ng-click`} it must evaluate the
expression inside the `$apply` method.

After evaluating the expression, the `$apply` method performs a {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest `$digest`}. In the $digest phase the scope examines all
of the `$watch` expressions and compares them with the previous value. This dirty checking is done
asynchronously. This means that assignment such as `$scope.username="angular"` will not
immediately cause a `$watch` to be notified, instead the `$watch` notification is delayed until
the `$digest` phase. This delay is desirable, since it coalesces multiple model updates into one
`$watch` notification as well as guarantees that during the `$watch` notification no other
`$watch`es are running. If a `$watch` changes the value of the model, it will force additional
`$digest` cycle.

  1. **Creation**

     The {@link ng.$rootScope root scope} is created during the application
     bootstrap by the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. During template
     linking, some directives create new child scopes.

  2. **Watcher registration**

     During template linking, directives register {@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches} on the scope. These watches will be
     used to propagate model values to the DOM.

  3. **Model mutation**

     For mutations to be properly observed, you should make them only within the {@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply scope.$apply()}. AngularJS APIs do this
     implicitly, so no extra `$apply` call is needed when doing synchronous work in controllers,
     or asynchronous work with {@link ng.$http $http}, {@link ng.$timeout $timeout}
     or {@link ng.$interval $interval} services.

  4. **Mutation observation**

     At the end of `$apply`, AngularJS performs a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
     $digest} cycle on the root scope, which then propagates throughout all child scopes. During
     the `$digest` cycle, all `$watch`ed expressions or functions are checked for model mutation
     and if a mutation is detected, the `$watch` listener is called.

  5. **Scope destruction**

     When child scopes are no longer needed, it is the responsibility of the child scope creator
     to destroy them via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$destroy scope.$destroy()}
     API. This will stop propagation of `$digest` calls into the child scope and allow for memory
     used by the child scope models to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.


### Scopes and Directives

During the compilation phase, the {@link compiler compiler} matches {@link
ng.$compileProvider#directive directives} against the DOM template. The directives
usually fall into one of two categories:

  - Observing {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}, such as
    double-curly expressions `{{expression}}`, register listeners using the {@link
    ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} method. This type of directive needs
    to be notified whenever the expression changes so that it can update the view.

  - Listener directives, such as {@link ng.directive:ngClick
    ng-click}, register a listener with the DOM. When the DOM listener fires, the directive
    executes the associated expression and updates the view using the {@link
    ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} method.

When an external event (such as a user action, timer or XHR) is received, the associated {@link
expression expression} must be applied to the scope through the {@link
ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} method so that all listeners are updated
correctly.

### Directives that Create Scopes

In most cases, {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives} and scopes interact
but do not create new instances of scope. However, some directives, such as {@link
ng.directive:ngController ng-controller} and {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ng-repeat},
create new child scopes and attach the child scope to the corresponding DOM element.

A special type of scope is the `isolate` scope, which does not inherit prototypically from the parent scope.
This type of scope is useful for component directives that should be isolated from their parent scope.
See the {@link guide/directive#isolating-the-scope-of-a-directive directives guide} for
more information about isolate scopes in custom directives.

Note also that component directives, which are created with the
{@link api/ng/type/angular.Module#component .component()} helper always create an isolate scope.

### Controllers and Scopes

Scopes and controllers interact with each other in the following situations:

   - Controllers use scopes to expose controller methods to templates (see {@link
     ng.directive:ngController ng-controller}).

   - Controllers define methods (behavior) that can mutate the model (properties on the scope).

   - Controllers may register {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches} on
     the model. These watches execute immediately after the controller behavior executes.

See the {@link ng.directive:ngController ng-controller} for more
information.


### Scope `$watch` Performance Considerations

Dirty checking the scope for property changes is a common operation in AngularJS and for this reason
the dirty checking function must be efficient. Care should be taken that the dirty checking
function does not do any DOM access, as DOM access is orders of magnitude slower than property
access on JavaScript object.

### Scope `$watch` Depths
<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="img/guide/concepts-scope-watch-strategies.png">

Dirty checking can be done with three strategies: By reference, by collection contents, and by value. The strategies differ in the kinds of changes they detect, and in their performance characteristics.

   - Watching *by reference* ({@link
      ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch scope.$watch} `(watchExpression, listener)`) detects a change when the whole value returned by the watch expression switches to a new value. If the value is an array or an object, changes inside it are not detected. This is the most efficient strategy.
   - Watching *collection contents* ({@link
      ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection scope.$watchCollection} `(watchExpression, listener)`) detects changes that occur inside an array or an object: When items are added, removed, or reordered. The detection is shallow - it does not reach into nested collections. Watching collection contents is more expensive than watching by reference, because copies of the collection contents need to be maintained. However, the strategy attempts to minimize the amount of copying required.
   - Watching *by value* ({@link
      ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch scope.$watch} `(watchExpression, listener, true)`) detects any change in an arbitrarily nested data structure. It is the most powerful change detection strategy, but also the most expensive. A full traversal of the nested data structure is needed on each digest, and a full copy of it needs to be held in memory.

## Integration with the browser event loop
<img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="img/guide/concepts-runtime.png">

The diagram and the example below describe how AngularJS interacts with the browser's event loop.

  1. The browser's event-loop waits for an event to arrive. An event is a user interaction, timer event,
     or network event (response from a server).
  2. The event's callback gets executed. This enters the JavaScript context. The callback can
      modify the DOM structure.
  3. Once the callback executes, the browser leaves the JavaScript context and
     re-renders the view based on DOM changes.

AngularJS modifies the normal JavaScript flow by providing its own event processing loop. This
splits the JavaScript into classical and AngularJS execution context. Only operations which are
applied in the AngularJS execution context will benefit from AngularJS data-binding, exception handling,
property watching, etc... You can also use $apply() to enter the AngularJS execution context from JavaScript. Keep in
mind that in most places (controllers, services) $apply has already been called for you by the
directive which is handling the event. An explicit call to $apply is needed only when
implementing custom event callbacks, or when working with third-party library callbacks.

  1. Enter the AngularJS execution context by calling {@link guide/scope scope}`.`{@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply}`(stimulusFn)`, where `stimulusFn` is
     the work you wish to do in the AngularJS execution context.
  2. AngularJS executes the `stimulusFn()`, which typically modifies application state.
  3. AngularJS enters the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} loop. The
     loop is made up of two smaller loops which process {@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync} queue and the {@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch} list. The {@link
     ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} loop keeps iterating until the model
     stabilizes, which means that the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync
     $evalAsync} queue is empty and the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch
     $watch} list does not detect any changes.
  4. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync} queue is used to
     schedule work which needs to occur outside of current stack frame, but before the browser's
     view render. This is usually done with `setTimeout(0)`, but the `setTimeout(0)` approach
     suffers from slowness and may cause view flickering since the browser renders the view after
     each event.
  5. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch} list is a set of expressions
     which may have changed since last iteration. If a change is detected then the `$watch`
     function is called which typically updates the DOM with the new value.
  6. Once the AngularJS {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} loop finishes,
     the execution leaves the AngularJS and JavaScript context. This is followed by the browser
     re-rendering the DOM to reflect any changes.


Here is the explanation of how the `Hello world` example achieves the data-binding effect when the
user enters text into the text field.

  1. During the compilation phase:
     1. the {@link ng.directive:ngModel ng-model} and {@link
        ng.directive:input input} {@link guide/directive
        directive} set up a `keydown` listener on the `<input>` control.
     2. the {@link ng.$interpolate interpolation}
        sets up a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch} to be notified of
        `name` changes.
  2. During the runtime phase:
     1. Pressing an '`X`' key causes the browser to emit a `keydown` event on the input control.
     2. The {@link ng.directive:input input} directive
        captures the change to the input's value and calls {@link
        ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply}`("name = 'X';")` to update the
        application model inside the AngularJS execution context.
     3. AngularJS applies the `name = 'X';` to the model.
     4. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} loop begins
     5. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch} list detects a change
        on the `name` property and notifies the {@link ng.$interpolate interpolation},
        which in turn updates the DOM.
     6. AngularJS exits the execution context, which in turn exits the `keydown` event and with it
        the JavaScript execution context.
     7. The browser re-renders the view with the updated text.

# Security

This document explains some of AngularJS's security features and best practices that you should
keep in mind as you build your application.


## Reporting a security issue

Email us at [security@angularjs.org](mailto:security@angularjs.org) to report any potential
security issues in AngularJS.

Please keep in mind the points below about AngularJS's expression language.


## Use the latest AngularJS possible

Like any software library, it is critical to keep AngularJS up to date. Please track the
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and make sure you are aware
of upcoming security patches and other updates.

Be ready to update rapidly when new security-centric patches are available.

Those that stray from AngularJS standards (such as modifying AngularJS's core) may have difficulty updating,
so keeping to AngularJS standards is not just a functionality issue, it's also critical in order to
facilitate rapid security updates.


## AngularJS Templates and Expressions

**If an attacker has access to control AngularJS templates or expressions, they can exploit an AngularJS application
via an XSS attack, regardless of the version.**

There are a number of ways that templates and expressions can be controlled:

* **Generating AngularJS templates on the server containing user-provided content**. This is the most common pitfall
  where you are generating HTML via some server-side engine such as PHP, Java or ASP.NET.
* **Passing an expression generated from user-provided content in calls to the following methods on a {@link scope scope}**:
  * `$watch(userContent, ...)`
  * `$watchGroup(userContent, ...)`
  * `$watchCollection(userContent, ...)`
  * `$eval(userContent)`
  * `$evalAsync(userContent)`
  * `$apply(userContent)`
  * `$applyAsync(userContent)`
* **Passing an expression generated from user-provided content in calls to services that parse expressions**:
  * `$compile(userContent)`
  * `$parse(userContent)`
  * `$interpolate(userContent)`
* **Passing an expression generated from user provided content as a predicate to `orderBy` pipe**:
  `{{ value | orderBy : userContent }}`

### Sandbox removal
Each version of AngularJS 1 up to, but not including 1.6, contained an expression sandbox, which reduced the surface area of
the vulnerability but never removed it. **In AngularJS 1.6 we removed this sandbox as developers kept relying upon it as a security
feature even though it was always possible to access arbitrary JavaScript code if one could control the AngularJS templates
or expressions of applications.**

Control of the AngularJS templates makes applications vulnerable even if there was a completely secure sandbox:
* https://ryhanson.com/stealing-session-tokens-on-plunker-with-an-angular-expression-injection/ in this blog post the author shows
  a (now closed) vulnerability in the Plunker application due to server-side rendering inside an AngularJS template.
* https://ryhanson.com/angular-expression-injection-walkthrough/ in this blog post the author describes an attack, which does not
  rely upon an expression sandbox bypass, that can be made because the sample application is rendering a template on the server that
  contains user entered content.

**It's best to design your application in such a way that users cannot change client-side templates.**

* Do not mix client and server templates
* Do not use user input to generate templates dynamically
* Do not run user input through `$scope.$eval` (or any of the other expression parsing functions listed above)
* Consider using {@link ng.directive:ngCsp CSP} (but don't rely only on CSP)

**You can use suitably sanitized server-side templating to dynamically generate CSS, URLs, etc, but not for generating templates that are
bootstrapped/compiled by AngularJS.**

**If you must continue to allow user-provided content in an AngularJS template then the safest option is to ensure that it is only
present in the part of the template that is made inert via the {@link ngNonBindable} directive.**


## HTTP Requests

Whenever your application makes requests to a server there are potential security issues that need
to be blocked. Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats.
AngularJS comes pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend
server cooperation is required.


### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)

Protection from XSRF is provided by using the double-submit cookie defense pattern.
For more information please visit {@link $http#cross-site-request-forgery-xsrf-protection XSRF protection}.

### JSON Hijacking Protection

Protection from JSON Hijacking is provided if the server prefixes all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
AngularJS will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
For more information please visit {@link $http#json-vulnerability-protection JSON Hijacking Protection}.

Bear in mind that calling `$http.jsonp` gives the remote server (and, if the request is not secured, any Man-in-the-Middle attackers)
instant remote code execution in your application: the result of these requests is handed off
to the browser as a regular `<script>` tag.

## Strict Contextual Escaping

Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain contexts to require
a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.

This mode is implemented by the {@link $sce} service and various core directives.

One example of such a context is rendering arbitrary content via the {@link ngBindHtml} directive. If the content is
provided by a user there is a chance of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The {@link ngBindHtml} directive will not
render content that is not marked as safe by {@link $sce}. The {@link ngSanitize} module can be used to clean such
user provided content and mark the content as safe.

**Be aware that marking untrusted data as safe via calls to {@link $sce#trustAsHtml `$sce.trustAsHtml`}, etc is
dangerous and will lead to Cross Site Scripting exploits.**

For more information please visit {@link $sce} and {@link ngSanitize.$sanitize}.

## Using Local Caches

There are various places that the browser can store (or cache) data. Within AngularJS there are objects created by
the {@link $cacheFactory}. These objects, such as {@link $templateCache} are used to store and retrieve data,
primarily used by {@link $http} and the {@link script} directive to cache templates and other data.

Similarly the browser itself offers `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects for caching data.

**Attackers with local access can retrieve sensitive data from this cache even when users are not authenticated.**

For instance in a long running Single Page Application (SPA), one user may "log out", but then another user
may access the application without refreshing, in which case all the cached data is still available.

For more information please visit [Web Storage Security](https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/web-storage-security/).

@ngdoc overview
@name  Services
@sortOrder 230
@description

# Services

AngularJS services are substitutable objects that are wired together using {@link di dependency
injection (DI)}. You can use services to organize and share code across your app.

AngularJS services are:

* Lazily instantiated – AngularJS only instantiates a service when an application component depends
  on it.
* Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance
  generated by the service factory.

AngularJS offers several useful services (like {@link ng.$http `$http`}), but for most applications
you'll also want to {@link services#creating-services create your own}.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Like other core AngularJS identifiers, built-in services always start with `$`
(e.g. `$http`).
</div>


## Using a Service

To use an AngularJS service, you add it as a dependency for the component (controller, service,
filter or directive) that depends on the service. AngularJS's {@link di dependency injection}
subsystem takes care of the rest.

<example module="myServiceModule" name="services-usage">
  <file name="index.html">
    <div id="simple" ng-controller="MyController">
      <p>Let's try this simple notify service, injected into the controller...</p>
      <input ng-init="message='test'" ng-model="message" >
      <button ng-click="callNotify(message);">NOTIFY</button>
      <p>(you have to click 3 times to see an alert)</p>
    </div>
  </file>

  <file name="script.js">
    angular.
     module('myServiceModule', []).
      controller('MyController', ['$scope', 'notify', function($scope, notify) {
        $scope.callNotify = function(msg) {
          notify(msg);
        };
      }]).
     factory('notify', ['$window', function(win) {
        var msgs = [];
        return function(msg) {
          msgs.push(msg);
          if (msgs.length === 3) {
            win.alert(msgs.join('\n'));
            msgs = [];
          }
        };
      }]);
  </file>

  <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
    it('should test service', function() {
      expect(element(by.id('simple')).element(by.model('message')).getAttribute('value'))
          .toEqual('test');
    });
  </file>
</example>


## Creating Services

Application developers are free to define their own services by registering the service's name and
**service factory function**, with an AngularJS module.

The **service factory function** generates the single object or function that represents the
service to the rest of the application. The object or function returned by the service is
injected into any component (controller, service, filter or directive) that specifies a dependency
on the service.

### Registering Services

Services are registered to modules via the {@link angular.Module Module API}.
Typically you use the {@link angular.Module#factory Module factory} API to register a service:

```js
var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);
myModule.factory('serviceId', function() {
  var shinyNewServiceInstance;
  // factory function body that constructs shinyNewServiceInstance
  return shinyNewServiceInstance;
});
```

Note that you are not registering a **service instance**, but rather a **factory function** that
will create this instance when called.

### Dependencies

Services can have their own dependencies. Just like declaring dependencies in a controller, you
declare dependencies by specifying them in the service's factory function signature.

For more on dependencies, see the {@link guide/di dependency injection} docs.

The example module below has two services, each with various dependencies:

```js
var batchModule = angular.module('batchModule', []);

/**
 * The `batchLog` service allows for messages to be queued in memory and flushed
 * to the console.log every 50 seconds.
 *
 * @param {*} message Message to be logged.
 */
batchModule.factory('batchLog', ['$interval', '$log', function($interval, $log) {
  var messageQueue = [];

  function log() {
    if (messageQueue.length) {
      $log.log('batchLog messages: ', messageQueue);
      messageQueue = [];
    }
  }

  // start periodic checking
  $interval(log, 50000);

  return function(message) {
    messageQueue.push(message);
  }
}]);

/**
 * `routeTemplateMonitor` monitors each `$route` change and logs the current
 * template via the `batchLog` service.
 */
batchModule.factory('routeTemplateMonitor', ['$route', 'batchLog', '$rootScope',
  function($route, batchLog, $rootScope) {
    return {
      startMonitoring: function() {
        $rootScope.$on('$routeChangeSuccess', function() {
          batchLog($route.current ? $route.current.template : null);
        });
      }
    };
  }]);

```

In the example, note that:

* The `batchLog` service depends on the built-in {@link ng.$interval `$interval`} and
  {@link ng.$log `$log`} services.
* The `routeTemplateMonitor` service depends on the built-in {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`}
  service and our custom `batchLog` service.
* Both services use the array notation to declare their dependencies.
* The order of identifiers in the array is the same as the order of argument
  names in the factory function.

### Registering a Service with `$provide`

You can also register services via the {@link auto.$provide `$provide`} service inside of a
module's `config` function:

```js
angular.module('myModule', []).config(['$provide', function($provide) {
  $provide.factory('serviceId', function() {
    var shinyNewServiceInstance;
    // factory function body that constructs shinyNewServiceInstance
    return shinyNewServiceInstance;
  });
}]);
```

This technique is often used in unit tests to mock out a service's dependencies.


## Unit Testing

The following is a unit test for the `notify` service from the {@link services#creating-services
Creating AngularJS Services} example above. The unit test example uses a Jasmine spy (mock) instead
of a real browser alert.

```js
var mock, notify;
beforeEach(module('myServiceModule'));
beforeEach(function() {
  mock = {alert: jasmine.createSpy()};

  module(function($provide) {
    $provide.value('$window', mock);
  });

  inject(function($injector) {
    notify = $injector.get('notify');
  });
});

it('should not alert first two notifications', function() {
  notify('one');
  notify('two');

  expect(mock.alert).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});

it('should alert all after third notification', function() {
  notify('one');
  notify('two');
  notify('three');

  expect(mock.alert).toHaveBeenCalledWith("one\ntwo\nthree");
});

it('should clear messages after alert', function() {
  notify('one');
  notify('two');
  notify('third');
  notify('more');
  notify('two');
  notify('third');

  expect(mock.alert.calls.count()).toEqual(2);
  expect(mock.alert.calls.mostRecent().args).toEqual(["more\ntwo\nthird"]);
});
```

# Templates

In AngularJS, templates are written with HTML that contains AngularJS-specific elements and attributes.
AngularJS combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic
view that a user sees in the browser.

These are the types of AngularJS elements and attributes you can use:

* {@link guide/directive Directive} — An attribute or element that
  augments an existing DOM element or represents a reusable DOM component.
* {@link ng.$interpolate Markup} — The double curly brace notation `{{ }}` to bind expressions
  to elements is built-in AngularJS markup.
* {@link guide/filter Filter} — Formats data for display.
* {@link forms Form controls} — Validates user input.

The following code snippet shows a template with {@link guide/directive directives} and
curly-brace {@link expression expression} bindings:

```html
<html ng-app>
 <!-- Body tag augmented with ngController directive  -->
 <body ng-controller="MyController">
   <input ng-model="foo" value="bar">
   <!-- Button tag with ngClick directive, and
          string expression 'buttonText'
          wrapped in "{{ }}" markup -->
   <button ng-click="changeFoo()">{{buttonText}}</button>
   <script src="angular.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>
```

In a simple app, the template consists of HTML, CSS, and AngularJS directives contained
in just one HTML file (usually `index.html`).

In a more complex app, you can display multiple views within one main page using "partials" –
segments of template located in separate HTML files. You can use the
{@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView} directive to load partials based on configuration passed
to the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. The {@link tutorial/ AngularJS tutorial} shows this
technique in steps seven and eight.

# Unit Testing

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which comes with great power of expression, but it also
comes with almost no help from the compiler. For this reason we feel very strongly that any code
written in JavaScript needs to come with a strong set of tests. We have built many features into
AngularJS which make testing your AngularJS applications easy. With AngularJS, there is no excuse for not testing.

## Separation of Concerns

Unit testing, as the name implies, is about testing individual units of code. Unit tests try to
answer questions such as "Did I think about the logic correctly?" or "Does the sort function order
the list in the right order?"

In order to answer such a question it is very important that we can isolate the unit of code under test.
That is because when we are testing the sort function we don't want to be forced into creating
related pieces such as the DOM elements, or making any XHR calls to fetch the data to sort.

While this may seem obvious it can be very difficult to call an individual function on a
typical project. The reason is that the developers often mix concerns resulting in a
piece of code which does everything. It makes an XHR request, it sorts the response data, and then it
manipulates the DOM.

With AngularJS, we try to make it easy for you to do the right thing. For your XHR requests, we
provide dependency injection, so your requests can be simulated. For the DOM, we abstract it, so you can
test your model without having to manipulate the DOM directly. Your tests can then
assert that the data has been sorted without having to create or look at the state of the DOM or to
wait for any XHR requests to return data. The individual sort function can be tested in isolation.

## With great power comes great responsibility

AngularJS is written with testability in mind, but it still requires that you do the right thing.
We tried to make the right thing easy, but if you ignore these guidelines you may end up with an
untestable application.

## Dependency Injection

AngularJS comes with {@link di dependency injection} built-in, which makes testing components much
easier, because you can pass in a component's dependencies and stub or mock them as you wish.

Components that have their dependencies injected allow them to be easily mocked on a test by
test basis, without having to mess with any global variables that could inadvertently affect
another test.

## Additional tools for testing AngularJS applications

For testing AngularJS applications there are certain tools that you should use that will make testing much
easier to set up and run.

### Karma

[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) is a JavaScript command line tool that can be used to spawn
a web server which loads your application's source code and executes your tests. You can configure
Karma to run against a number of browsers, which is useful for being confident that your application
works on all browsers you need to support. Karma is executed on the command line and will display
the results of your tests on the command line once they have run in the browser.

Karma is a NodeJS application, and should be installed through npm/yarn. Full installation instructions
are available on [the Karma website](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/installation.html).

### Jasmine

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) is a behavior driven development framework for
JavaScript that has become the most popular choice for testing AngularJS applications. Jasmine
provides functions to help with structuring your tests and also making assertions. As your tests
grow, keeping them well structured and documented is vital, and Jasmine helps achieve this.

In Jasmine we use the `describe` function to group our tests together:

```js
describe("sorting the list of users", function() {
  // individual tests go here
});
```

And then each individual test is defined within a call to the `it` function:

```js
describe('sorting the list of users', function() {
  it('sorts in descending order by default', function() {
    // your test assertion goes here
  });
});
```

Grouping related tests within `describe` blocks and describing each individual test within an
`it` call keeps your tests self documenting.

Finally, Jasmine provides matchers which let you make assertions:

```js
describe('sorting the list of users', function() {
  it('sorts in descending order by default', function() {
    var users = ['jack', 'igor', 'jeff'];
    var sorted = sortUsers(users);
    expect(sorted).toEqual(['jeff', 'jack', 'igor']);
  });
});
```

Jasmine comes with a number of matchers that help you make a variety of assertions. You should [read
the Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html#section-Matchers) to see
what they are. To use Jasmine with Karma, we use the
[karma-jasmine](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-jasmine) test runner.

### angular-mocks

AngularJS also provides the {@link ngMock} module, which provides mocking for your tests. This is used
to inject and mock AngularJS services within unit tests. In addition, it is able to extend other
modules so they are synchronous. Having tests synchronous keeps them much cleaner and easier to work
with. One of the most useful parts of ngMock is {@link ngMock.$httpBackend}, which lets us mock XHR
requests in tests, and return sample data instead.

## Testing a Controller

Because AngularJS separates logic from the view layer, it keeps controllers easy to test. Let's take a
look at how we might test the controller below, which provides `$scope.grade`, which sets a property
on the scope based on the length of the password.

```js
angular.module('app', [])
  .controller('PasswordController', function PasswordController($scope) {
    $scope.password = '';
    $scope.grade = function() {
      var size = $scope.password.length;
      if (size > 8) {
        $scope.strength = 'strong';
      } else if (size > 3) {
        $scope.strength = 'medium';
      } else {
        $scope.strength = 'weak';
      }
    };
  });
```

Because controllers are not available on the global scope, we need to use {@link
angular.mock.inject} to inject our controller first. The first step is to use the `module` function,
which is provided by angular-mocks. This loads in the module it's given, so it is available in your
tests. We pass this into `beforeEach`, which is a function Jasmine provides that lets us run code
before each test. Then we can use `inject` to access `$controller`, the service that is responsible
for instantiating controllers.

```js
describe('PasswordController', function() {
  beforeEach(module('app'));

  var $controller, $rootScope;

  beforeEach(inject(function(_$controller_, _$rootScope_){
    // The injector unwraps the underscores (_) from around the parameter names when matching
    $controller = _$controller_;
    $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
  }));

  describe('$scope.grade', function() {
    it('sets the strength to "strong" if the password length is >8 chars', function() {
      var $scope = $rootScope.$new();
      var controller = $controller('PasswordController', { $scope: $scope });
      $scope.password = 'longerthaneightchars';
      $scope.grade();
      expect($scope.strength).toEqual('strong');
    });
  });
});
```

Notice how by nesting the `describe` calls and being descriptive when calling them with strings, the
test is very clear. It documents exactly what it is testing, and at a glance you can quickly see
what is happening. Now let's add the test for when the password is less than three characters, which
should see `$scope.strength` set to "weak":

```js
describe('PasswordController', function() {
  beforeEach(module('app'));

  var $controller;

  beforeEach(inject(function(_$controller_){
    // The injector unwraps the underscores (_) from around the parameter names when matching
    $controller = _$controller_;
  }));

  describe('$scope.grade', function() {
    it('sets the strength to "strong" if the password length is >8 chars', function() {
      var $scope = {};
      var controller = $controller('PasswordController', { $scope: $scope });
      $scope.password = 'longerthaneightchars';
      $scope.grade();
      expect($scope.strength).toEqual('strong');
    });

    it('sets the strength to "weak" if the password length <3 chars', function() {
      var $scope = {};
      var controller = $controller('PasswordController', { $scope: $scope });
      $scope.password = 'a';
      $scope.grade();
      expect($scope.strength).toEqual('weak');
    });
  });
});
```

Now we have two tests, but notice the duplication between the tests. Both have to
create the `$scope` variable and create the controller. As we add new tests, this duplication is
only going to get worse. Thankfully, Jasmine provides `beforeEach`, which lets us run a function
before each individual test. Let's see how that would tidy up our tests:

```js
describe('PasswordController', function() {
  beforeEach(module('app'));

  var $controller;

  beforeEach(inject(function(_$controller_){
    // The injector unwraps the underscores (_) from around the parameter names when matching
    $controller = _$controller_;
  }));

  describe('$scope.grade', function() {
    var $scope, controller;

    beforeEach(function() {
      $scope = {};
      controller = $controller('PasswordController', { $scope: $scope });
    });

    it('sets the strength to "strong" if the password length is >8 chars', function() {
      $scope.password = 'longerthaneightchars';
      $scope.grade();
      expect($scope.strength).toEqual('strong');
    });

    it('sets the strength to "weak" if the password length <3 chars', function() {
      $scope.password = 'a';
      $scope.grade();
      expect($scope.strength).toEqual('weak');
    });
  });
});
```

We've moved the duplication out and into the `beforeEach` block. Each individual test now
only contains the code specific to that test, and not code that is general across all tests. As you
expand your tests, keep an eye out for locations where you can use `beforeEach` to tidy up tests.
`beforeEach` isn't the only function of this sort that Jasmine provides, and the [documentation
lists the others](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html#section-Setup_and_Teardown).

## Testing Filters
{@link ng.$filterProvider Filters} are functions which transform the data into a user readable
format. They are important because they remove the formatting responsibility from the application
logic, further simplifying the application logic.

```js
myModule.filter('length', function() {
  return function(text) {
    return ('' + (text || '')).length;
  }
});

describe('length filter', function() {

  var $filter;

  beforeEach(inject(function(_$filter_){
    $filter = _$filter_;
  }));

  it('returns 0 when given null', function() {
    var length = $filter('length');
    expect(length(null)).toEqual(0);
  });

  it('returns the correct value when given a string of chars', function() {
    var length = $filter('length');
    expect(length('abc')).toEqual(3);
  });
});
```

## Testing Directives
Directives in AngularJS are responsible for encapsulating complex functionality within custom HTML tags,
attributes, classes or comments. Unit tests are very important for directives because the components
you create with directives may be used throughout your application and in many different contexts.

### Simple HTML Element Directive

Let's start with an AngularJS app with no dependencies.

```js
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
```

Now we can add a directive to our app.

```js
app.directive('aGreatEye', function () {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        replace: true,
        template: '<h1>lidless, wreathed in flame, {{1 + 1}} times</h1>'
    };
});
```

This directive is used as a tag `<a-great-eye></a-great-eye>`. It replaces the entire tag with the
template `<h1>lidless, wreathed in flame, {{1 + 1}} times</h1>`. Now we are going to write a jasmine unit test to
verify this functionality. Note that the expression `{{1 + 1}}` times will also be evaluated in the rendered content.

```js
describe('Unit testing great quotes', function() {
  var $compile,
      $rootScope;

  // Load the myApp module, which contains the directive
  beforeEach(module('myApp'));

  // Store references to $rootScope and $compile
  // so they are available to all tests in this describe block
  beforeEach(inject(function(_$compile_, _$rootScope_){
    // The injector unwraps the underscores (_) from around the parameter names when matching
    $compile = _$compile_;
    $rootScope = _$rootScope_;
  }));

  it('Replaces the element with the appropriate content', function() {
    // Compile a piece of HTML containing the directive
    var element = $compile("<a-great-eye></a-great-eye>")($rootScope);
    // fire all the watches, so the scope expression {{1 + 1}} will be evaluated
    $rootScope.$digest();
    // Check that the compiled element contains the templated content
    expect(element.html()).toContain("lidless, wreathed in flame, 2 times");
  });
});
```

We inject the $compile service and $rootScope before each jasmine test. The $compile service is used
to render the aGreatEye directive. After rendering the directive we ensure that the directive has
replaced the content and "lidless, wreathed in flame, 2 times" is present.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Underscore notation**:

The use of the underscore notation (e.g.: `_$rootScope_`) is a convention wide spread in AngularJS
community to keep the variable names clean in your tests. That's why the
{@link $injector} strips out the leading and the trailing underscores when
matching the parameters. The underscore rule applies ***only*** if the name starts **and** ends with
exactly one underscore, otherwise no replacing happens.
</div>

### Testing Transclusion Directives

Directives that use transclusion are treated specially by the compiler.  Before their compile
function is called, the contents of the directive's element are removed from the element and
provided via a transclusion function.  The directive's template is then appended to the directive's
element, to which it can then insert the transcluded content into its template.


Before compilation:
```html
<div transclude-directive>
  Some transcluded content
</div>
```

After transclusion extraction:
```html
<div transclude-directive></div>
```

After compilation:
```html
<div transclude-directive>
  Some Template
  <span ng-transclude>Some transcluded content</span>
</div>
```

If the directive is using 'element' transclusion, the compiler will actually remove the
directive's entire element from the DOM and replace it with a comment node. The compiler then
inserts the directive's template "after" this comment node, as a sibling.

Before compilation
```html
<div element-transclude>
  Some Content
</div>
```

After transclusion extraction
```html
<!-- elementTransclude -->
```

After compilation:
```html
<!-- elementTransclude -->
<div element-transclude>
  Some Template
  <span ng-transclude>Some transcluded content</span>
</div>
```

It is important to be aware of this when writing tests for directives that use 'element'
transclusion.  If you place the directive on the root element of the DOM fragment that you
pass to {@link $compile}, then the DOM node returned from the linking function will be the
comment node and you will lose the ability to access the template and transcluded content.

```javascript
var node = $compile('<div element-transclude></div>')($rootScope);
expect(node[0].nodeType).toEqual(node.COMMENT_NODE);
expect(node[1]).toBeUndefined();
```

To cope with this you simply ensure that your 'element' transclude directive is wrapped in an
element, such as a `<div>`.

```javascript
var node = $compile('<div><div element-transclude></div></div>')($rootScope);
var contents = node.contents();
expect(contents[0].nodeType).toEqual(node.COMMENT_NODE);
expect(contents[1].nodeType).toEqual(node.ELEMENT_NODE);
```

### Testing Directives With External Templates

If your directive uses `templateUrl`, consider using
[karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor)
to pre-compile HTML templates and thus avoid having to load them over HTTP during test execution.
Otherwise you may run into issues if the test directory hierarchy differs from the application's.

## Testing Promises

When testing promises, it's important to know that the resolution of promises is tied to the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest digest cycle}.
That means a promise's `then`, `catch` and `finally` callback functions are only called after a digest has run.
In tests, you can trigger a digest by calling a scope's {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply `$apply` function}.
If you don't have a scope in your test, you can inject the {@link ng.$rootScope $rootScope} and call `$apply` on it.
There is also an example of testing promises in the {@link ng.$q#testing `$q` service documentation}.

## Using `beforeAll()`

Jasmine's `beforeAll()` and mocha's `before()` hooks are often useful for sharing test setup - either to reduce test run-time or simply to make for more focused test cases.

By default, ngMock will create an injector per test case to ensure your tests do not affect each other. However, if we want to use `beforeAll()`, ngMock will have to create the injector before any test cases are run, and share that injector through all the cases for that `describe`. That is where {@link angular.mock.module.sharedInjector module.sharedInjector()} comes in. When it's called within a `describe` block, a single injector is shared between all hooks and test cases run in that block.

In the example below we are testing a service that takes a long time to generate its answer. To avoid having all of the assertions we want to write in a single test case, {@link angular.mock.module.sharedInjector module.sharedInjector()} and Jasmine's `beforeAll()` are used to run the service only once. The test cases then all make assertions about the properties added to the service instance.

```javascript
describe("Deep Thought", function() {

  module.sharedInjector();

  beforeAll(module("UltimateQuestion"));

  beforeAll(inject(function(DeepThought) {
    expect(DeepThought.answer).toBeUndefined();
    DeepThought.generateAnswer();
  }));

  it("has calculated the answer correctly", inject(function(DeepThought) {
    // Because of sharedInjector, we have access to the instance of the DeepThought service
    // that was provided to the beforeAll() hook. Therefore we can test the generated answer
    expect(DeepThought.answer).toBe(42);
  }));

  it("has calculated the answer within the expected time", inject(function(DeepThought) {
    expect(DeepThought.runTimeMillennia).toBeLessThan(8000);
  }));

  it("has double checked the answer", inject(function(DeepThought) {
    expect(DeepThought.absolutelySureItIsTheRightAnswer).toBe(true);
  }));

});
```

# PhoneCat Tutorial App

A great way to get introduced to AngularJS is to work through this tutorial, which walks you through
the construction of an AngularJS web app. The app you will build is a catalog that displays a list
of Android devices, lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you, and then view
details for any device.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/catalog_screen.png" width="488" height="413"
    alt="demo application running in the browser">

Follow the tutorial to see how AngularJS makes browsers smarter — without the use of native
extensions or plug-ins:

* See examples of how to use client-side data binding to build dynamic views of data that change
  immediately in response to user actions.
* See how AngularJS keeps your views in sync with your data without the need for DOM manipulation.
* Learn a better, easier way to test your web apps, with Karma and Protractor.
* Learn how to use dependency injection and services to make common web tasks, such as getting data
  into your app, easier.

When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:

* Create a dynamic application that works in all modern browsers.
* Use data binding to wire up your data model to your views.
* Create and run unit tests, with Karma.
* Create and run end-to-end tests, with Protractor.
* Move application logic out of the template and into components and controllers.
* Get data from a server using AngularJS services.
* Apply animations to your application, using the `ngAnimate` module.
* Structure your AngularJS applications in a modular way that scales well for larger projects.
* Identify resources for learning more about AngularJS.

The tutorial guides you through the entire process of building a simple application, including
writing and running unit and end-to-end tests. Experiments at the end of each step provide
suggestions for you to learn more about AngularJS and the application you are building.

You can go through the whole tutorial in a couple of hours or you may want to spend a pleasant day
really digging into it. If you're looking for a shorter introduction to AngularJS, check out the
{@link misc/started Getting Started} document.


# Environment Setup

The rest of this page explains how you can set up your local machine for development.
If you just want to _read_ the tutorial, you can go straight to the first step:
[Step 0 - Bootstrapping](tutorial/step_00).


## Working with the Code

You can follow along with this tutorial and hack on the code in the comfort of your own computer.
This way, you can get hands-on practice of really writing AngularJS code and also on using the
recommended testing tools.

The tutorial relies on the use of the [Git][git] versioning system for source code management.
You don't need to know anything about Git to follow the tutorial other than how to install and run
a few git commands.


### Install Git

You can download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/download. Once installed, you should have
access to the `git` command line tool. The main commands that you will need to use are:

* `git clone ...`: Clone a remote repository onto your local machine.
* `git checkout ...`: Check out a particular branch or a tagged version of the code to hack on.


### Download angular-phonecat

Clone the [angular-phonecat repository][angular-phonecat] located at GitHub by running the following
command:

```
git clone --depth=16 https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git
```

This command creates an `angular-phonecat` sub-directory in your current directory.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  The `--depth=16` option tells Git to pull down only the last 16 commits.
  This makes the download much smaller and faster.
</div>

Change your current directory to `angular-phonecat`.

```
cd angular-phonecat
```

The tutorial instructions, from now on, assume you are running all commands from within the
`angular-phonecat` directory.


### Install Node.js

In order to install dependencies (such as the test tools and AngularJS itself) and run the
preconfigured local web server, you will also need [Node.js v6+][node].

You can download a Node.js installer for your operating system from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

Check the version of Node.js that you have installed by running the following command:

```
node --version
```

In Debian based distributions, there might be a name clash with another utility called `node`. The
suggested solution is to also install the `nodejs-legacy` apt package, which renames `node` to
`nodejs`.

```
apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
nodejs --version
npm --version
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  If you need to run different versions of Node.js in your local environment, consider installing
  [Node Version Manager (nvm)][nvm] or [Node Version Manager (nvm) for Windows][nvm-windows].
</div>

By installing Node.js, you also get [npm][npm], which is a command line executable for downloading
and managing Node.js packages. We use it to download the AngularJS framework as well as development
and testing tools.

Once you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can download these dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

This command reads angular-phonecat's `package.json` file and downloads the following dependencies
into the `node_modules` directory:

* [Http-Server][http-server] - simple local static web server
* [Karma][karma] - unit test runner
* [Protractor][protractor] - end-to-end (E2E) test runner

Running `npm install` will also automatically copy the AngularJS framework and other dependencies
necessary for our app to work into the `app/lib/` directory.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note the angular-phonecat project is setup to install and run these utilities via npm scripts.
  This means that you do not have to have any of these utilities installed globally on your system
  to follow the tutorial. See [Installing Helper Tools](tutorial/#install-helper-tools-optional-)
  below for more information.
</div>

The project is preconfigured with a number of npm helper scripts to make it easy to run the common
tasks that you will need while developing:

* `npm start`: Start a local development web server.
* `npm test`: Start the Karma unit test runner.
* `npm run protractor`: Run the Protractor end-to-end (E2E) tests.
* `npm run update-webdriver`: Install the drivers needed by Protractor.


### Install Helper Tools (optional)

The Http-Server, Karma and Protractor modules are also executables, which can be installed globally
and run directly from a terminal/command prompt. You don't need to do this to follow the tutorial,
but if you decide you do want to run them directly, you can install these modules globally using,
`sudo npm install --global ...`.

For instance, to install the `http-server` command line executable you would do:

```
sudo npm install --global http-server
```

_(Omit the sudo if running on Windows.)_

Then you can run the `http-server` tool directly, such as:

```
http-server ./app
```


### Running the Development Web Server

While AngularJS applications are purely client-side code, and it is possible to open them in a web
browser directly from the file system, it is better to serve them from an HTTP web server. In
particular, for security reasons, most modern browsers will not allow JavaScript to make server
requests if the page is loaded directly from the file system.

The angular-phonecat project is configured with a simple static web server for hosting the
application during development. Start the web server by running:

```
npm start
```

This will create a local web server that is listening to port 8000 on your local machine.
You can now browse to the application at http://localhost:8000/index.html.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  To serve the web app on a different IP address or port, edit the "start" script within
  `package.json`. You can use `-a` to set the address and `-p` to set the port. You also need to
  update the `baseUrl` configuration property in `e2e-test/protractor.conf.js`.
</div>


### Running Unit Tests

We use unit tests to ensure that the JavaScript code in our application is operating correctly.
Unit tests focus on testing small isolated parts of the application. The unit tests are kept in test
files (specs) side-by-side with the application code. This way it's easier to find them and keep
them up-to-date with the code under test. It also makes refactoring our app structure easier, since
tests are moved together with the source code.

The angular-phonecat project is configured to use [Karma][karma] to run the unit tests for the
application. Start Karma by running:

```
npm test
```

This will start the Karma unit test runner. Karma will read the configuration file `karma.conf.js`,
located at the root of the project directory. This configuration file tells Karma to:

* Open up instances of the Chrome and Firefox browsers and connect them to Karma.
* Execute all the unit tests in these browsers.
* Report the results of these tests in the terminal/command line window.
* Watch all the project's JavaScript files and re-run the tests whenever any of these change.

It is good to leave this running all the time, in the background, as it will give you immediate
feedback about whether your changes pass the unit tests while you are working on the code.


### Running E2E Tests

We use E2E (end-to-end) tests to ensure that the application as a whole operates as expected.
E2E tests are designed to test the whole client-side application, in particular that the views are
displaying and behaving correctly. It does this by simulating real user interaction with the real
application running in the browser.

The E2E tests are kept in the `e2e-tests` directory.

The angular-phonecat project is configured to use [Protractor][protractor] to run the E2E tests for
the application. Protractor relies upon a set of drivers to allow it to interact with the browser.
You can install these drivers by running:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  You don't have to manually run this command. Our npm scripts are configured so that it will be
  automatically executed as part of the command that runs the E2E tests.
</div>

Since Protractor works by interacting with a running application, we need to start our web server:

```
npm start
```

Then, in a _separate_ terminal/command line window, we can run the Protractor test scripts against
the application by running:

```
npm run protractor
```

Protractor will read the configuration file at `e2e-tests/protractor.conf.js`. This configuration
file tells Protractor to:

* Open up a Chrome browser and connect it to the application.
* Execute all the E2E tests in this browser.
* Report the results of these tests in the terminal/command line window.
* Close the browser and exit.

It is good to run the E2E tests whenever you make changes to the HTML views or want to check that
the application as a whole is executing correctly. It is very common to run E2E tests before pushing
a new commit of changes to a remote repository.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>
    Each version of Protractor is compatible with specific browser versions. If you are reading this
    some time in the future, it is possible that the specified Protractor version is no longer
    compatible with the latest version of Chrome that you are using.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that is the case, you can try upgrading Protractor to newer version. For instructions on how
    to upgrade dependencies see [Updating dependencies](tutorial/#updating-dependencies).
  </p>
</div>


### Updating dependencies

In order to avoid surprises, all dependencies listed in `package.json` are pinned to specific
versions (this is what the [package-lock.json][package-lock] file is about). This ensures that the
same version of a dependency is installed every time.

Since all dependencies are acquired via npm, you can use the same tool to easily update them as
well (although you probably don't need to for the purpose of this tutorial). Simply run the
preconfigured script:

```
npm run update-deps
```

This will update all packages to the latest version that satisfy their version ranges (as specified
in `package.json`) and also copy the necessary files into `app/lib/`. For example, if `package.json`
contains `"some-package": "1.2.x"`, it will be updated to the latest 1.2.x version (e.g. 1.2.99),
but not to 1.3.x (e.g. 1.3.0).

If you want to update a dependency to a version newer than what the specificed range would permit,
you can change the version range in `package.json` and then run `npm run update-deps` as usual.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  See [here][semver-ranges] for more info on the various version range formats.
</div>


### Common Issues

<br />
**Firewall / Proxy issues**

Git and other tools, often use the `git:` protocol for accessing files in remote repositories.
Some firewall configurations are blocking `git://` URLs, which leads to errors when trying to clone
repositories or download dependencies. (For example corporate firewalls are "notorious" for blocking
`git:`.)

If you run into this issue, you can force the use of `https:` instead, by running the following
command: `git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://`

<br />
**Updating WebDriver takes too long**

Running `update-webdriver` for the first time may take from several seconds up to a few minutes
(depending on your hardware and network connection). If you cancel the operation (e.g. using
`Ctrl+C`), you might get errors, when trying to run Protractor later.

In that case, you can delete the `node_modules/` directory and run `npm install` again.

<br />
**Protractor dependencies**

Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires
the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
`java -version` from the command line.

If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].

<br />
**Error running the web server**

The web server is configured to use port 8000. If the port is already in use (for example by another
instance of a running web server) you will get an `EADDRINUSE` error. Make sure the port is
available, before running `npm start`.

## tutorial/step_00.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 0 - Bootstrapping
@step 0
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="0"></ul>

In this step of the tutorial, you will become familiar with the most important source code files of
the AngularJS Phonecat App. You will also learn how to start the development servers bundled with
[angular-seed][angular-seed], and run the application in the browser.

Before you continue, make sure you have set up your development environment and installed all
necessary dependencies, as described in the {@link tutorial/#environment-setup Environment Setup}
section.

In the `angular-phonecat` directory, run this command:

```
git checkout -f step-0
```

This resets your workspace to step 0 of the tutorial app.

You must repeat this for every future step in the tutorial and change the number to the number of
the step you are on. This will cause any changes you made within your working directory to be lost.

If you haven't already done so, you need to install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

To see the app running in a browser, open a _separate_ terminal/command line tab or window, then run
`npm start` to start the web server. Now, open a browser window for the app and navigate to
http://localhost:8000/index.html.

Note that if you already ran the master branch app prior to checking out step-0, you may see the
cached master version of the app in your browser window at this point. Just hit refresh to re-load
the page.

You can now see the page in your browser. It's not very exciting, but that's OK.

The HTML page that displays "Nothing here yet!" was constructed with the HTML code shown below.
The code contains some key AngularJS elements that we will need as we progress.

**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" ng-app>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My HTML File</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
    <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>Nothing here {{'yet' + '!'}}</p>

  </body>
</html>
```


## What is the code doing?

<br />
**`ng-app` attribute:**

```html
<html ng-app>
```

The `ng-app` attribute represents an AngularJS directive, named `ngApp` (AngularJS uses `kebab-case` for
its custom attributes and `camelCase` for the corresponding directives which implement them). This
directive is used to flag the HTML element that AngularJS should consider to be the root element of
our application. This gives application developers the freedom to tell AngularJS if the entire HTML
page or only a portion of it should be treated as the AngularJS application.

For more info on `ngApp`, check out the {@link ngApp API Reference}.

<br />
**`angular.js` script tag:**

```html
<script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
```

This code downloads the `angular.js` script which registers a callback that will be executed by the
browser when the containing HTML page is fully downloaded. When the callback is executed, AngularJS
looks for the {@link ngApp ngApp} directive. If AngularJS finds the directive, it will bootstrap the
application with the root of the application DOM being the element on which the `ngApp` directive
was defined.

For more info on bootstrapping your app, checkout the [Bootstrap](guide/bootstrap) section of the
Developer Guide.

<br />
**Double-curly binding with an expression:**

```html
Nothing here {{'yet' + '!'}}
```

This line demonstrates two core features of AngularJS's templating capabilities:

* A binding, denoted by double-curlies: `{{ }}`
* A simple expression used in this binding: `'yet' + '!'`

The binding tells AngularJS that it should evaluate an expression and insert the result into the DOM
in place of the binding. As we will see in the next steps, rather than a one-time insert, a binding
will result in efficient continuous updates whenever the result of the expression evaluation
changes.

{@link guide/expression AngularJS expressions} are JavaScript-like code snippets that are evaluated by
AngularJS in the context of the current model scope, rather than within the scope of the global
context (`window`).

As expected, once this template is processed by AngularJS, the HTML page contains the text:

```
Nothing here yet!
```

## Bootstrapping AngularJS Applications

Bootstrapping AngularJS applications automatically using the `ngApp` directive is very easy and
suitable for most cases. In advanced cases, such as when using script loaders, you can use the
{@link guide/bootstrap#manual-initialization imperative/manual way} to bootstrap the application.

There are 3 important things that happen during the bootstrap phase:

1. The {@link auto.$injector injector} that will be used for dependency injection is created.

2. The injector will then create the {@link ng.$rootScope root scope} that will become the context
   for the model of our application.

3. AngularJS will then "compile" the DOM starting at the `ngApp` root element, processing any
   directives and bindings found along the way.

Once an application is bootstrapped, it will then wait for incoming browser events (such as mouse
clicks, key presses or incoming HTTP responses) that might change the model. Once such an event
occurs, AngularJS detects if it caused any model changes and if changes are found, AngularJS will
reflect them in the view by updating all of the affected bindings.

The structure of our application is currently very simple. The template contains just one directive
and one static binding, and our model is empty. That will soon change!

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_00.png">


## What are all these files in my working directory?

Most of the files in your working directory come from the [angular-seed project][angular-seed],
which is typically used to bootstrap new AngularJS projects. The seed project is pre-configured to
install the AngularJS framework (via `npm` into the `app/lib/` directory) and tools for developing
and testing a typical web application (via `npm`).

For the purposes of this tutorial, we modified the angular-seed with the following changes:

* Removed the example app.
* Removed unused dependencies.
* Added phone images to `app/img/phones/`.
* Added phone data files (JSON) to `app/phones/`.
* Added a dependency on [Bootstrap][bootstrap-3.3] in the `package.json` file.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Try adding a new expression to `index.html` that will do some math:

  ```html
  <p>1 + 2 = {{1 + 2}}</p>
  ```


## Summary

Now let's go to {@link step_01 step 1} and add some content to the web app.

## tutorial/step_01.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 1 - Static Template
@step 1
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="1"></ul>

In order to illustrate how AngularJS enhances standard HTML, you will create a purely *static* HTML
page and then examine how we can turn this HTML code into a template that AngularJS will use to
dynamically display the same result with any set of data.

In this step you will add some basic information about two cell phones to an HTML page.

* The page now contains a list with information about two phones.

<div doc-tutorial-reset="1"></div>

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Nexus S</span>
      <p>
        Fast just got faster with Nexus S.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Motorola XOOM™ with Wi-Fi</span>
      <p>
        The Next, Next Generation tablet.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
```


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Try adding more static HTML to `index.html`. For example:

  ```html
  <p>Total number of phones: 2</p>
  ```


## Summary

This addition to your app uses static HTML to display the list. Now, let's go to
{@link step_02 step 2} to learn how to use AngularJS to dynamically generate the same list.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="1"></ul>

## tutorial/step_02.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 2 - AngularJS Templates
@step 2
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="2"></ul>

Now, it's time to make the web page dynamic — with AngularJS. We will also add a test that verifies
the code for the controller we are going to add.

There are many ways to structure the code for an application. For AngularJS applications, we encourage
the use of the [Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern][mvc-pattern] to decouple the code and
separate concerns. With that in mind, let's use a little AngularJS and JavaScript to add models,
views, and controllers to our app.

* The list of three phones is now generated dynamically from data

<div doc-tutorial-reset="2"></div>


## View and Template

In AngularJS, the **view** is a projection of the model through the HTML **template**. This means that
whenever the model changes, AngularJS refreshes the appropriate binding points, which updates the
view.

The view is constructed by AngularJS from this template.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<html ng-app="phonecatApp">
<head>
  ...
  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body ng-controller="PhoneListController">

  <ul>
    <li ng-repeat="phone in phones">
      <span>{{phone.name}}</span>
      <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

</body>
</html>
```

We replaced the hard-coded phone list with the {@link ngRepeat ngRepeat} directive and two
{@link guide/expression AngularJS expressions}:

* The `ng-repeat="phone in phones"` attribute on the `<li>` tag is an AngularJS repeater directive.
  The repeater tells AngularJS to create a `<li>` element for each phone in the list, using the `<li>`
  tag as the template.
* The expressions wrapped in curly braces (`{{phone.name}}` and `{{phone.snippet}}`) will be
  replaced by the values of the expressions.

We have also added a new directive, called {@link ngController ngController}, which attaches a
`PhoneListController` **controller** to the `<body>` tag. At this point:

* `PhoneListController` is in charge of the DOM sub-tree under (and including) the `<body>` element.
* The expressions in curly braces (`{{phone.name}}` and `{{phone.snippet}}`) denote bindings, which
  are referring to our application model, which is set up in our `PhoneListController` controller.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note: We have specified an {@link angular.Module AngularJS Module} to load using
  `ng-app="phonecatApp"`, where `phonecatApp` is the name of our module. This module will contain
  the `PhoneListController`.
</div>


## Model and Controller

The data **model** (a simple array of phones in object literal notation) is now instantiated within
the `PhoneListController` **controller**. The **controller** is simply a constructor function that
takes a `$scope` parameter:

<br />
**`app/app.js`:**

```js
// Define the `phonecatApp` module
var phonecatApp = angular.module('phonecatApp', []);

// Define the `PhoneListController` controller on the `phonecatApp` module
phonecatApp.controller('PhoneListController', function PhoneListController($scope) {
  $scope.phones = [
    {
      name: 'Nexus S',
      snippet: 'Fast just got faster with Nexus S.'
    }, {
      name: 'Motorola XOOM™ with Wi-Fi',
      snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.'
    }, {
      name: 'MOTOROLA XOOM™',
      snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.'
    }
  ];
});

```

Here we declared a controller called `PhoneListController` and registered it in an AngularJS module,
`phonecatApp`. Notice that our `ngApp` directive (on the `<html>` tag) now specifies the
`phonecatApp` module name as the module to load when bootstrapping the application.

Although the controller is not yet doing very much, it plays a crucial role. By providing context
for our data model, the controller allows us to establish data-binding between the model and the
view. We connected the dots between the presentation, data, and logic components as follows:

* The {@link ngController ngController} directive, located on the `<body>` tag, references the name
  of our controller, `PhoneListController` (located in the JavaScript file `app.js`).

* The `PhoneListController` controller attaches the phone data to the `$scope` that was injected
  into our controller function. This _scope_ is a prototypal descendant of the _root scope_ that was
  created when the application was defined. This controller scope is available to all bindings
  located within the `<body ng-controller="PhoneListController">` tag.


### Scope

The concept of a scope in AngularJS is crucial. A scope can be seen as the glue which allows the
template, model, and controller to work together. AngularJS uses scopes, along with the information
contained in the template, data model, and controller, to keep models and views separate, but in
sync. Any changes made to the model are reflected in the view; any changes that occur in the view
are reflected in the model.

To learn more about AngularJS scopes, see the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope AngularJS scope documentation}.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_02.png">

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>
    AngularJS scopes prototypically inherit from their parent scope, all the way up to the *root scope*
    of the application. As a result, assigning values directly on the scope makes it easy to share
    data across different parts of the page and create interactive applications.
    While this approach works for prototypes and smaller applications, it quickly leads to tight
    coupling and difficulty to reason about changes in our data model.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next step, we will learn how to better organize our code, by "packaging" related pieces
    of application and presentation logic into isolated, reusable entities, called components.
  </p>
</div>


## Testing

### Testing Controllers

The "AngularJS way" of separating the controller from the view makes it easy to test code as it is being
developed. In the section "Model and Controller" we have registered our controller via a constructor
function on the `phonecatApp` module.

In tests, we use an AngularJS service, `$controller`, which will retrieve a controller by name. It
also takes a second argument - a map of dependencies that should be injected.

The following test instantiates `PhoneListController` with a mock scope object,
and verifies that the phones array property on the scope contains three records.

This example demonstrates how easy it is to create a unit test for
code in AngularJS. Since testing is such a critical part of software development, we make it easy to
create tests in AngularJS so that developers are encouraged to write them.

<br />
**`app/app.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('PhoneListController', function() {

  beforeEach(module('phonecatApp'));

  it('should create a `phones` model with 3 phones', inject(function($controller) {
    var scope = {};
    var ctrl = $controller('PhoneListController', {$scope: scope});

    expect(scope.phones.length).toBe(3);
  }));

});
```

* Before each test we tell AngularJS to load the `phonecatApp` module.
* We ask AngularJS to `inject` the `$controller` service into our test function.
* We use `$controller` to create an instance of the `PhoneListController`.
* With this instance, we verify that the phones array property on the scope contains three records.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>**A note on file naming:**</p>
  <p>
    As already mentioned in the [introduction](tutorial/#running-unit-tests), the unit test files
    (specs) are kept side-by-side with the application code. We name our specs after the file
    containing the code to be tested plus a specific suffix to distinguish them from files
    containing application code. Note that test files are still plain JavaScript files, so they have
    a `.js` file extension.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this tutorial, we are using the `.spec` suffix. So the test file corresponding to
    `something.js` would be called `something.spec.js`.
    (Another common convention is to use a `_spec` or `_test` suffix.)
  </p>
</div>


### Writing and Running Tests

Many AngularJS developers prefer the syntax of
[Jasmine's Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework][jasmine-home], when writing tests. Although
AngularJS does not require you to use Jasmine, we wrote all of the tests in this tutorial in Jasmine
v2.4. You can learn about Jasmine on the [Jasmine home page][jasmine-home] and at the
[Jasmine docs][jasmine-docs].

The angular-seed project is pre-configured to run unit tests using [Karma][karma], but you will need
to ensure that Karma and its necessary plugins are installed. You can do this by running
`npm install`.

To run the tests, and then watch the files for changes execute: `npm test`

* Karma will start new instances of Chrome and Firefox browsers automatically. Just ignore them and
  let them run in the background. Karma will use these browsers for test execution.
* If you only have one of the browsers installed on your machine (either Chrome or Firefox), make
  sure to update the karma configuration file (`karma.conf.js`), before running the test. Locate the
  configuration file in the root directory and update the `browsers` property.

  E.g. if you only have Chrome installed:
  <pre>
    ...
    browsers: ['Chrome'],
    ...
  </pre>

* You should see the following or similar output in the terminal:

  <pre>
    INFO [karma]: Karma server started at http://localhost:9876/
    INFO [launcher]: Starting browser Chrome
    INFO [Chrome 49.0]: Connected on socket ... with id ...
    Chrome 49.0: Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.05 secs / 0.04 secs)
  </pre>

  Yay! The test passed! Or not...

* To rerun the tests, just change any of the source or test `.js` files. Karma will notice the change
  and will rerun the tests for you. Now isn't that sweet?

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Make sure you don't minimize the browser that Karma opened. On some OS, memory assigned to a
  minimized browser is limited, which results in your karma tests running extremely slow.
</div>


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Add another binding to `index.html`. For example:

  ```html
  <p>Total number of phones: {{phones.length}}</p>
  ```

* Create a new model property in the controller and bind to it from the template. For example:

  ```js
  $scope.name = 'world';
  ```

  Then add a new binding to `index.html`:

  ```html
  <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
  ```

  Refresh your browser and verify that it says 'Hello, world!'.

* Update the unit test for the controller in `app/app.spec.js` to reflect the previous change.
  For example by adding:

  ```js
  expect(scope.name).toBe('world');
  ```

* Create a repeater in `index.html` that constructs a simple table:

  ```html
  <table>
    <tr><th>Row number</th></tr>
    <tr ng-repeat="i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"><td>{{i}}</td></tr>
  </table>
  ```

  Now, make the list 1-based by incrementing `i` by one in the binding:

  ```html
  <table>
    <tr><th>Row number</th></tr>
    <tr ng-repeat="i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"><td>{{i+1}}</td></tr>
  </table>
  ```

  Extra points: Try and make an 8x8 table using an additional `ng-repeat`.

* Make the unit test fail by changing `expect(scope.phones.length).toBe(3)` to instead use
  `toBe(4)`.


## Summary

We now have a dynamic application which separates models, views, and controllers, and we are testing
as we go. Let's go to {@link step_03 step 3} to learn how to improve our application's architecture,
by utilizing components.

## tutorial/step_03.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 3 - Components
@step 3
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="3"></ul>

In the previous step, we saw how a controller and a template worked together to convert a static
HTML page into a dynamic view. This is a very common pattern in Single-Page Applications in general
(and AngularJS applications in particular):

* Instead of creating a static HTML page on the server, the client-side code "takes over" and
  interacts dynamically with the view, updating it instantly to reflect changes in model data or
  state, usually as a result of user interaction (we'll see an example shortly in
  {@link step_05 step 5}).

The **template** (the part of the view containing the bindings and presentation logic) acts as a
blueprint for how our data should be organized and presented to the user.
The **controller** provides the context in which the bindings are evaluated and applies behavior
and logic to our template.

There are still a couple of areas we can do better:

1. What if we want to reuse the same functionality in a different part of our application ?<br />
   We would need to duplicate the whole template (including the controller). This is error-prone and
   hurts maintainability.
2. The scope, that glues our controller and template together into a dynamic view, is not isolated
   from other parts of the page. What this means is that a random, unrelated change in a different
   part of the page (e.g. a property-name conflict) could have unexpected and hard-to-debug side
   effects on our view.

   (OK, this might not be a real concern in our minimal example, but it **is** a valid concern for
    bigger, real-world applications.)


<div doc-tutorial-reset="3"></div>


## Components to the rescue!

Since this combination (template + controller) is such a common and recurring pattern, AngularJS
provides an easy and concise way to combine them together into reusable and isolated entities,
known as _components_.
Additionally, AngularJS will create a so called _isolate scope_ for each instance of our component,
which means no prototypal inheritance and no risk of our component affecting other parts of the
application or vice versa.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    Since this is an introductory tutorial, we are not going to dive deep into all features provided
    by AngularJS **components**. You can read more about components and their usage patterns in the
    [Components](guide/component) section of the Developer Guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, one could think of components as an opinionated and stripped-down version of their more
    complex and verbose (but powerful) siblings, **directives**, which are AngularJS's way of teaching
    HTML new tricks. You can read all about them in the [Directives](guide/directive) section of the
    Developer Guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    (**Note:** Directives are an advanced topic, so you might want to postpone studying them, until
               you have mastered the basics.)
  </p>
</div>

To create a component, we use the {@link angular.Module#component .component()} method of an
{@link module AngularJS module}. We must provide the name of the component and the Component
Definition Object (CDO for short).

Remember that (since components are also directives) the name of the component is in `camelCase`
(e.g. `myAwesomeComponent`), but we will use `kebab-case` (e.g. `my-awesome-component`) when
referring to it in our HTML. (See [here][case-styles] for a description of different case styles.)

In its simplest form, the CDO will just contain a template and a controller. (We can actually omit
the controller and AngularJS will create a dummy controller for us. This is useful for simple
"presentational" components, that don't attach any behavior to the template.)

Let's see an example:

```js
  angular.
    module('myApp').
    component('greetUser', {
      template: 'Hello, {{$ctrl.user}}!',
      controller: function GreetUserController() {
        this.user = 'world';
      }
    });
```

```html
<body>
  <!-- The following line is how to use the `greetUser` component above in your html doc. -->
  <greet-user></greet-user>
</body>
```
 
Now, every time we include `<greet-user></greet-user>` in our view, AngularJS will expand it into a
DOM sub-tree constructed using the provided `template` and managed by an instance of the specified
controller.

But wait, where did that `$ctrl` come from and what does it refer to ?

For reasons already mentioned (and for other reasons that are out of the scope of this tutorial), it
is considered a good practice to avoid using the scope directly. We can (and should) use our
controller instance; i.e. assign our data and methods on properties of our controller (the "`this`"
inside the controller constructor), instead of directly to the scope.

From the template, we can refer to our controller instance using an alias. This way, the context of
evaluation for our expressions is even more clear. By default, components use `$ctrl` as the
controller alias, but we can override it, should the need arise.

There are more options available, so make sure you check out the
{@link ng.$compileProvider#component API Reference}, before using `.component()` in your own
applications.


## Using Components

Now that we know how to create components, let's refactor the HTML page to make use of our newly
acquired skill.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<html ng-app="phonecatApp">
<head>
  ...
  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="app.js"></script>
  <script src="phone-list.component.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- Use a custom component to render a list of phones -->
  <phone-list></phone-list>  <!-- This tells AngularJS to instantiate a `phoneList` component here. -->

</body>
</html>
```

<br />
**`app/app.js`:**

```js
// Define the `phonecatApp` module
angular.module('phonecatApp', []);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-list.component.js`:**

```js
// Register `phoneList` component, along with its associated controller and template
angular.
  module('phonecatApp').
  component('phoneList', {  // This name is what AngularJS uses to match to the `<phone-list>` element.
    template:
        '<ul>' +
          '<li ng-repeat="phone in $ctrl.phones">' +
            '<span>{{phone.name}}</span>' +
            '<p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>' +
          '</li>' +
        '</ul>',
    controller: function PhoneListController() {
      this.phones = [
        {
          name: 'Nexus S',
          snippet: 'Fast just got faster with Nexus S.'
        }, {
          name: 'Motorola XOOM™ with Wi-Fi',
          snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.'
        }, {
          name: 'MOTOROLA XOOM™',
          snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.'
        }
      ];
    }
  });
```

Voilà! The resulting output should look the same, but let's see what we have gained:

* Our phone list is reusable. Just drop `<phone-list></phone-list>` anywhere in the page to get a
  list of phones.
* Our main view (`index.html`) is cleaner and more declarative. Just by looking at it, we know there
  is a list of phones. We are not bothered with implementation details.
* Our component is isolated and safe from "external influences". Likewise, we don't have to worry,
  that we might accidentally break something in some other part of the application. What happens
  inside our component, stays inside our component.
* It's easier to test our component in isolation.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_03.png">

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>**A note on file naming:**</p>
  <p>
    It is a good practice to distinguish different types of entities by suffix. In this tutorial, we
    are using the `.component` suffix for components, so the definition of a `someComponent`
    component would be in a file named `some-component.component.js`.
  </p>
</div>


## Testing

Although we have combined our controller with a template into a component, we still can (and should)
unit test the controller separately, since this is where our application logic and data reside.

In order to retrieve and instantiate a component's controller, AngularJS provides the
{@link ngMock.$componentController $componentController} service.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  The `$controller` service that we used in the previous step can only instantiate controllers that
  were registered by name, using the `.controller()` method. We could have registered our component
  controller this way, too, if we wanted to. Instead, we chose to define it inline &mdash; inside
  the CDO &mdash; to keep things localized, but either way works equally well.
</div>

<br />
**`app/phone-list.component.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('phoneList', function() {

  // Load the module that contains the `phoneList` component before each test
  beforeEach(module('phonecatApp'));

  // Test the controller
  describe('PhoneListController', function() {

    it('should create a `phones` model with 3 phones', inject(function($componentController) {
      var ctrl = $componentController('phoneList');

      expect(ctrl.phones.length).toBe(3);
    }));

  });

});
```

The test retrieves the controller associated with the `phoneList` component, instantiates it and
verifies that the phones array property on it contains three records. Note that the data is now on
the controller instance itself, not on a `scope`.


### Running Tests

Same as before, execute `npm test` to run the tests and then watch the files for changes.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Try the experiments from the previous step, this time on the `phoneList` component.

* Add a couple more phone lists on the page, by just adding more `<phone-list></phone-list>`
  elements in `index.html`. Now add another binding to the `phoneList` component's template:

  ```js
    template:
        '<p>Total number of phones: {{$ctrl.phones.length}}</p>' +
        '<ul>' +
        ...
  ```

  Reload the page and watch the new "feature" propagate to all phone lists. In real-world
  applications, where the phone lists could appear on several different pages, being able to change
  or add something in one place (e.g. a component's template) and have that change propagate
  throughout the application, is a big win.


## Summary

You have learned how to organize your application and presentation logic into isolated, reusable
components. Let's go to {@link step_04 step 4} to learn how to organize our code in directories and
files, so it remains easy to locate as our application grows.

@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="4"></ul>


In this step, we will not be adding any new functionality to our application. Instead, we are going
to take a step back, refactor our codebase and move files and code around, in order to make our
application more easily expandable and maintainable.

In the previous step, we saw how to architect our application to be modular and testable. What's
equally important though, is organizing our codebase in a way that makes it easy (both for us and
other developers on our team) to navigate through the code and quickly locate the pieces that are
relevant to a specific feature or section of the application.

To that end, we will explain why and how we:

* Put each entity in its **own file**.
* Organize our code by **feature area**, instead of by function.
* Split our code into **modules** that other modules can depend on.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  We will keep it short, not going into great detail on every good practice and convention. These
  principles are explained in great detail in the [AngularJS Style Guide][styleguide], which also
  contains many more techniques for effectively organizing AngularJS codebases.
</div>


<div doc-tutorial-reset="4"></div>


## One Feature per File

It might be tempting, for the sake of simplicity, to put everything in one file, or have one file
per type; e.g. all controllers in one file, all components in another file, all services in a third
file, and so on.
This might seem to work well in the beginning, but as our application grows it becomes a burden to
maintain. As we add more and more features, our files will get bigger and bigger and it will be
difficult to navigate and find the code we are looking for.

Instead we should put each feature/entity in its own file. Each stand-alone controller will be
defined in its own file, each component will be defined in its own file, etc.

Luckily, we don't need to change anything with respect to that guideline in our code, since we have
already defined our `phoneList` component in its own `phone-list.component.js` file. Good job!

We will keep this in mind though, as we add more features.


## Organizing by Feature

So, now that we learned we should put everything in its own file, our `app/` directory will soon be
full with dozens of files and specs (remember we keep our unit test files next to the corresponding
source code files). What's more important, logically related files will not be grouped together; it
will be really difficult to locate all files related to a specific section of the application and
make a change or fix a bug.

So, what shall we do?

Well, we are going to group our files into directories _by feature_. For example, since we have a
section in our application that lists phones, we will put all related files into a `phone-list/`
directory under `app/`. We are soon to find out that certain features are used across different
parts of the application. We will put those inside `app/core/`.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    Other typical names for our `core` directory are `shared`, `common` and `components`. The last
    one is kind of misleading though, as it will contain other things than components as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    (This is mostly a relic of the past, when "components" just meant the generic building blocks of
     an application.)
  </p>
</div>

Based on what we have discussed so far, here is our directory/file layout for the `phoneList`
"feature":

```
  app/
    phone-list/
      phone-list.component.js
      phone-list.component.spec.js
    app.js
```


## Using Modules

As previously mentioned, one of the benefits of having a modular architecture is code reuse &mdash;
not only inside the same application, but across applications too. There is one final step in making
this code reuse frictionless:

* Each feature/section should declare its own module and all related entities should register
  themselves on that module.

Let's take the `phoneList` feature as an example. Previously, the `phoneList` component would
register itself on the `phonecatApp` module:

```js
  angular.
    module('phonecatApp').
    component('phoneList', ...);
```

Similarly, the accompanying spec file loads the `phonecatApp` module before each test (because
that's where our component is registered). Now, imagine that we need a list of phones on another
project that we are working on. Thanks to our modular architecture, we don't have to reinvent the
wheel; we simply copy the `phone-list/` directory on our other project and add the necessary script
tags in our `index.html` file and we are done, right?

Well, not so fast. The new project doesn't know anything about a `phonecatApp` module. So, we would
have to replace all references to `phonecatApp` with the name of this project's main module. As you
can imagine this is both laborious and error-prone.

Yeah, you guessed it: There is a better way!

Each feature/section, will declare its own module and have all related entities registered there.
The main module (`phonecatApp`) will declare a dependency on each feature/section module. Now,
all it takes to reuse the same code on a new project is copying the feature directory over and
adding the feature module as a dependency in the new project's main module.

Here is what our `phoneList` feature will look like after this change:

<br />
**`/`:**

```
  app/
    phone-list/
      phone-list.module.js
      phone-list.component.js
      phone-list.component.spec.js
    app.module.js
```

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.module.js`:**

```js
// Define the `phoneList` module
angular.module('phoneList', []);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js`:**

```js
// Register the `phoneList` component on the `phoneList` module,
angular.
  module('phoneList').
  component('phoneList', {...});
```

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**<br />
_(since `app/app.js` now only contains the main module declaration, we gave it a `.module` suffix)_

```js
// Define the `phonecatApp` module
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  // ...which depends on the `phoneList` module
  'phoneList'
]);
```

By passing `phoneList` inside the dependencies array when defining the `phonecatApp` module, AngularJS
will make all entities registered on `phoneList` available on `phonecatApp` as well.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    Don't forget to also update your `index.html` adding a `<script>` tag for each JavaScript file
    we have created. This might seem tedious, but is totally worth it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a production-ready application, you would concatenate and minify all your JavaScript files
    anyway (for performance reasons), so this won't be an issue any more.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Note that files defining a module (i.e. `.module.js`) need to be included before other files that
  add features (e.g. components, controllers, services, filters) to that module.
</div>


## External Templates

Since we are at refactoring, let's do one more thing. As we learned, components have templates,
which are basically fragments of HTML code that dictate how our data is laid out and presented to
the user. In {@link step_03 step 3}, we saw how we can specify the template for a component as a
string using the `template` property of the CDO (Component Definition Object).
Having HTML code in a string isn't ideal, especially for bigger templates. It would be much better,
if we could have our HTML code in `.html` files. This way, we would get all the support our
IDE/editor has to offer (e.g. HTML-specific color-highlighting and auto-completion) and also keep
our component definitions cleaner.

So, while it's perfectly fine to keep our component templates inline (using the `template` property
of the CDO), we are going to use an external template for our `phoneList` component. In order to
denote that we are using an external template, we use the `templateUrl` property and specify the URL
that our template will be loaded from. Since we want to keep our template close to where the
component is defined, we place it inside `app/phone-list/`.

We copied the contents of the `template` property (the HTML code) into
`app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html` and modified our CDO like this:

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js`:**

```js
angular.
  module('phoneList').
  component('phoneList', {
    // Note: The URL is relative to our `index.html` file
    templateUrl: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',
    controller: ...
  });
```

At runtime, when AngularJS needs to create an instance of the `phoneList` component, it will make an
HTTP request to get the template from `app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html`.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Keeping inline with our convention, we will be using the `.template` suffix for external
  templates. Another common convention is to just have the `.html` extension
  (e.g. `phone-list.html`).
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p>
    Using an external template like this, will result in more HTTP requests to the server (one for
    each external template). Although AngularJS takes care not to make extraneous requests (e.g.
    fetching the templates lazily, caching the results, etc), additional requests do have a cost
    (especially on mobile devices and data-plan connections).
  </p>
  <p>
    Luckily, there are ways to avoid the extra costs (while still keeping your templates external).
    A detailed discussion of the subject is outside the scope of this tutorial, but you can take a
    look at the {@link ng.$templateRequest $templateRequest} and
    {@link ng.$templateCache $templateCache} services for more info on how AngularJS manages external
    templates.
  </p>
</div>


## Final Directory/File Layout

After all the refactorings that took place, this is how our application looks from the outside:

<br />
**`/`:**

```
  app/
    phone-list/
      phone-list.component.js
      phone-list.component.spec.js
      phone-list.module.js
      phone-list.template.html
    app.css
    app.module.js
    index.html
```


## Testing

Since this was just a refactoring step (no actual code addition/deletions), we shouldn't need to
change much (if anything) as far as our specs are concerned.

One thing that we can (and should) change is the name of the module to be loaded before each test in
`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.spec.js`. We don't need to pull in the whole `phonecatApp`
module (which will soon grow to depend on more stuff). All we want to test is already included in
the much smaller `phoneList` module, so it suffices to just load that.
This is one extra benefit that we get out of our modular architecture for free.

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('phoneList', function() {

  // Load the module that contains the `phoneList` component before each test
  beforeEach(module('phoneList'));

  ...

});
```

If not already done so, run the tests (using the `npm test` command) and verify that they still
pass.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  One of the great things about tests is the confidence they provide, when refactoring your
  application. It's easy to break something as you start moving files around and re-arranging
  modules. Having good test coverage is the quickest, easiest and most reliable way of knowing that
  your application will continue to work as expected.
</div>


## Summary

Even if we didn't add any new and exciting functionality to our application, we have made a great
step towards a well-architected and maintainable application. Time to spice things up. Let's go to
{@link step_05 step 5} to learn how to add full-text search to the application.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="4"></ul>

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 5 - Filtering Repeaters
@step 5
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="5"></ul>


We did a lot of work in laying a foundation for the app in the previous steps, so now we'll do
something simple; we will add full-text search (yes, it will be simple!). We will also write an
end-to-end (E2E) test, because a good E2E test is a good friend. It stays with your app, keeps an
eye on it, and quickly detects regressions.

* The app now has a search box. Notice that the phone list on the page changes depending on what a
  user types into the search box.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="5"></div>


## Component Controller

We made no changes to the component's controller.


## Component Template

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html`:**

```html
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2">
        <!--Sidebar content-->

        Search: <input ng-model="$ctrl.query" />

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-10">
        <!--Body content-->

        <ul class="phones">
          <li ng-repeat="phone in $ctrl.phones | filter:$ctrl.query">
            <span>{{phone.name}}</span>
            <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

We added a standard HTML `<input>` tag and used AngularJS's {@link ng.filter:filter filter} function
to process the input for the {@link ngRepeat ngRepeat} directive.

By virtue of the {@link ngModel ngModel} directive, this lets a user enter search criteria and
immediately see the effects of their search on the phone list. This new code demonstrates the
following:

* Data-binding: This is one of the core features in AngularJS. When the page loads, AngularJS binds the
  value of the input box to the data model variable specified with `ngModel` and keeps the two in
  sync.

  In this code, the data that a user types into the input box (bound to **`$ctrl.query`**) is
  immediately available as a filter input in the list repeater
  (`phone in $ctrl.phones | filter:`**`$ctrl.query`**). When changes to the data model cause the
  repeater's input to change, the repeater efficiently updates the DOM to reflect the current state
  of the model.

  <img  class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_05.png">

* Use of the `filter` filter: The {@link ng.filter:filter filter} function uses the `$ctrl.query`
  value to create a new array that contains only those records that match the query.

  `ngRepeat` automatically updates the view in response to the changing number of phones returned
  by the `filter` filter. The process is completely transparent to the developer.


## Testing

In previous steps, we learned how to write and run unit tests. Unit tests are perfect for testing
controllers and other parts of our application written in JavaScript, but they can't easily
test templates, DOM manipulation or interoperability of components and services. For these, an
end-to-end (E2E) test is a much better choice.

The search feature was fully implemented via templates and data-binding, so we'll write our first
E2E test, to verify that the feature works.

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`:**

```js
describe('PhoneCat Application', function() {

  describe('phoneList', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html');
    });

    it('should filter the phone list as a user types into the search box', function() {
      var phoneList = element.all(by.repeater('phone in $ctrl.phones'));
      var query = element(by.model('$ctrl.query'));

      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(3);

      query.sendKeys('nexus');
      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(1);

      query.clear();
      query.sendKeys('motorola');
      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(2);
    });

  });

});
```

This test verifies that the search box and the repeater are correctly wired together. Notice how
easy it is to write E2E tests in AngularJS. Although this example is for a simple test, it really is
that easy to set up any functional, readable, E2E test.


### Running E2E Tests with Protractor

Even though the syntax of this test looks very much like our controller unit test written with
Jasmine, the E2E test uses APIs of [Protractor][protractor]. Read about the Protractor APIs in the
[Protractor API Docs][protractor-docs].

Much like Karma is the test runner for unit tests, we use Protractor to run E2E tests. Try it with
`npm run protractor`. E2E tests take time, so unlike with unit tests, Protractor will exit after the
tests run and will not automatically rerun the test suite on every file change.
To rerun the test suite, execute `npm run protractor` again.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **Note:** In order for protractor to access and run tests against your application, it must be
  served via a web server. In a different terminal/command line window, run `npm start` to fire up
  the web server.
</div>


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Display the current value of the `query` model by adding a `{{$ctrl.query}}` binding into the
  `phone-list.template.html` template and see how it changes, when you type in the input box.

  You might also try to add the `{{$ctrl.query}}` binding to `index.html`. However, when you reload
  the page, you won't see the expected result. This is because the `query` model lives in the scope
  defined by the `<phone-list>` component.<br />
  Component isolation at work!


## Summary

We have now added full-text search and included a test to verify that it works! Now let's go on to
{@link step_06 step 6} to learn how to add sorting capabilities to the PhoneCat application.

@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="6"></ul>


In this step, we will add a feature to let our users control the order of the items in the phone
list. The dynamic ordering is implemented by creating a new model property, wiring it together with
the repeater, and letting the data binding magic do the rest of the work.

* In addition to the search box, the application displays a drop-down menu that allows users to
  control the order in which the phones are listed.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="6"></div>


## Component Template

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html`:**

```html
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2">
        <!--Sidebar content-->

        <p>
          Search:
          <input ng-model="$ctrl.query">
        </p>

        <p>
          Sort by:
          <select ng-model="$ctrl.orderProp">
            <option value="name">Alphabetical</option>
            <option value="age">Newest</option>
          </select>
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-10">
        <!--Body content-->

        <ul class="phones">
          <li ng-repeat="phone in $ctrl.phones | filter:$ctrl.query | orderBy:$ctrl.orderProp">
            <span>{{phone.name}}</span>
            <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

We made the following changes to the `phone-list.template.html` template:

* First, we added a `<select>` element bound to `$ctrl.orderProp`, so that our users can pick from
  the two provided sorting options.

* We then chained the `filter` filter with the {@link orderBy orderBy} filter to further process the
  input for the repeater. `orderBy` is a filter that takes an input array, copies it and reorders
  the copy which is then returned.

  AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the `$ctrl.orderProp` model.
  `$ctrl.orderProp` is then used as the input for the `orderBy` filter.

As we discussed in the section about data-binding and the repeater in {@link step_05 step 5},
whenever the model changes (for example because a user changes the order with the select drop-down
menu), AngularJS's data-binding will cause the view to automatically update. No bloated DOM
manipulation code is necessary!


## Component Controller

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneList').
    component('phoneList', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',
      controller: function PhoneListController() {
        this.phones = [
          {
            name: 'Nexus S',
            snippet: 'Fast just got faster with Nexus S.',
            age: 1
          }, {
            name: 'Motorola XOOM™ with Wi-Fi',
            snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.',
            age: 2
          }, {
            name: 'MOTOROLA XOOM™',
            snippet: 'The Next, Next Generation tablet.',
            age: 3
          }
        ];

        this.orderProp = 'age';
      }
    });
```

* We modified the `phones` model - the array of phones - and added an `age` property to each phone
  record. This property is used to order the phones by age.

* We added a line to the controller that sets the default value of `orderProp` to `age`. If we had
  not set a default value here, the `orderBy` filter would remain uninitialized until the user
  picked an option from the drop-down menu.

This is a good time to talk about two-way data-binding. Notice that when the application is loaded
in the browser, "Newest" is selected in the drop-down menu. This is because we set `orderProp` to
`'age'` in the controller. So the binding works in the direction from our model to the UI. Now if
you select "Alphabetically" in the drop-down menu, the model will be updated as well and the phones
will be reordered. That is the data-binding doing its job in the opposite direction — from the UI to
the model.


## Testing

The changes we made should be verified with both a unit test and an E2E test. Let's look at the unit
test first.

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('phoneList', function() {

  // Load the module that contains the `phoneList` component before each test
  beforeEach(module('phoneList'));

  // Test the controller
  describe('PhoneListController', function() {
    var ctrl;

    beforeEach(inject(function($componentController) {
      ctrl = $componentController('phoneList');
    }));

    it('should create a `phones` model with 3 phones', function() {
      expect(ctrl.phones.length).toBe(3);
    });

    it('should set a default value for the `orderProp` model', function() {
      expect(ctrl.orderProp).toBe('age');
    });

  });

});
```

The unit test now verifies that the default ordering property is set.

We used Jasmine's API to extract the controller construction into a `beforeEach` block, which is
shared by all tests in the parent `describe` block.

You should now see the following output in the Karma tab:

```
Chrome 49.0: Executed 2 of 2 SUCCESS (0.136 secs / 0.08 secs)
```

Let's turn our attention to the E2E tests.

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`:**

```js
  describe('PhoneCat Application', function() {

    describe('phoneList', function() {

      ...

      it('should be possible to control phone order via the drop-down menu', function() {
        var queryField = element(by.model('$ctrl.query'));
        var orderSelect = element(by.model('$ctrl.orderProp'));
        var nameOption = orderSelect.element(by.css('option[value="name"]'));
        var phoneNameColumn = element.all(by.repeater('phone in $ctrl.phones').column('phone.name'));

        function getNames() {
          return phoneNameColumn.map(function(elem) {
            return elem.getText();
          });
        }

        queryField.sendKeys('tablet');   // Let's narrow the dataset to make the assertions shorter

        expect(getNames()).toEqual([
          'Motorola XOOM\u2122 with Wi-Fi',
          'MOTOROLA XOOM\u2122'
        ]);

        nameOption.click();

        expect(getNames()).toEqual([
          'MOTOROLA XOOM\u2122',
          'Motorola XOOM\u2122 with Wi-Fi'
        ]);
      });

      ...
```

The E2E test verifies that the ordering mechanism of the select box is working correctly.

You can now rerun `npm run protractor` to see the tests run.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* In the `phoneList` component's controller, remove the statement that sets the `orderProp` value
  and you'll see that AngularJS will temporarily add a new blank ("unknown") option to the drop-down
  list and the ordering will default to unordered/natural order.

* Add a `{{$ctrl.orderProp}}` binding into the `phone-list.template.html` template to display its
  current value as text.

* Reverse the sort order by adding a `-` symbol before the sorting value:
  `<option value="-age">Oldest</option>`
  After making this change, you'll notice that the drop-down list has a blank option selected and does not default to age anymore.
  Fix this by updating the `orderProp` value in `phone-list.component.js` to match the new value on the `<option>` element.


## Summary

Now that you have added list sorting and tested the application, go to {@link step_07 step 7} to
learn about AngularJS services and how AngularJS uses dependency injection.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="6"></ul>

## tutorial/step_07.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 7 - XHR & Dependency Injection
@step 7
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="7"></ul>


Enough of building an app with three phones in a hard-coded dataset! Let's fetch a larger dataset
from our server using one of AngularJS's built-in {@link guide/services services} called
{@link ng.$http $http}. We will use AngularJS's {@link guide/di dependency injection (DI)} to
provide the service to the `phoneList` component's controller.

* There is now a list of 20 phones, loaded from the server.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="7"></div>


## Data

The `app/phones/phones.json` file in our project is a dataset that contains a larger list of phones,
stored in JSON format.

Following is a sample of the file:

```json
[
  {
    "age": 13,
    "id": "motorola-defy-with-motoblur",
    "name": "Motorola DEFY\u2122 with MOTOBLUR\u2122",
    "snippet": "Are you ready for everything life throws your way?"
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```


## Component Controller

We will use AngularJS's {@link ng.$http $http} service in our controller for making an HTTP request to
our web server to fetch the data in the `app/phones/phones.json` file. `$http` is just one of
several built-in {@link guide/services AngularJS services} that handle common operations in web
applications. AngularJS injects these services for you, right where you need them.

Services are managed by AngularJS's {@link guide/di DI subsystem}. Dependency injection helps to make
your web applications both well-structured (e.g. separate entities for presentation, data, and
control) and loosely coupled (dependencies between entities are not resolved by the entities
themselves, but by the DI subsystem). As a result, applications are easier to test as well.

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js:`**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneList').
    component('phoneList', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',
      controller: function PhoneListController($http) {
        var self = this;
        self.orderProp = 'age';

        $http.get('phones/phones.json').then(function(response) {
          self.phones = response.data;
        });
      }
    });
```

`$http` makes an HTTP GET request to our web server, asking for `phones.json` (the URL is relative
to our `index.html` file). The server responds by providing the data in the JSON file.
(The response might just as well have been dynamically generated by a backend server. To the
browser and our app, they both look the same. For the sake of simplicity, we will use JSON files
in this tutorial.)

The `$http` service returns a {@link ng.$q promise object}, which has a `then()` method. We call
this method to handle the asynchronous response and assign the phone data to the controller, as a
property called `phones`. Notice that AngularJS detected the JSON response and parsed it for us into
the `data` property of the `response` object passed to our callback!

Since we are making the assignment of the `phones` property in a callback function, where the `this`
value is not defined, we also introduce a local variable called `self` that points back to the
controller instance.

To use a service in AngularJS, you simply declare the names of the dependencies you need as arguments
to the controller's constructor function, as follows:

```js
function PhoneListController($http) {...}
```

AngularJS's dependency injector provides services to your controller, when the controller is being
constructed. The dependency injector also takes care of creating any transitive dependencies the
service may have (services often depend upon other services).

Note that the names of arguments are significant, because the injector uses these to look up the
dependencies.

<img  class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_05.png">


### `$`-prefix Naming Convention

You can create your own services, and in fact we will do exactly that a few steps down the road. As
a naming convention, AngularJS's built-in services, Scope methods and a few other AngularJS APIs have a
`$` prefix in front of the name.

The `$` prefix is there to namespace AngularJS-provided services. To prevent collisions it's best to
avoid naming your services and models anything that begins with a `$`.

If you inspect a Scope, you may also notice some properties that begin with `$$`. These properties
are considered private, and should not be accessed or modified.


### A Note on Minification

Since AngularJS infers the controller's dependencies from the names of arguments to the controller's
constructor function, if you were to [minify][minification] the JavaScript code for the
`PhoneListController` controller, all of its function arguments would be minified as well, and the
dependency injector would not be able to identify services correctly.

We can overcome this problem by annotating the function with the names of the dependencies, provided
as strings, which will not get minified. There are two ways to provide these injection annotations:

* Create an `$inject` property on the controller function which holds an array of strings.
  Each string in the array is the name of the service to inject for the corresponding parameter.
  In our example, we would write:

  ```js
      function PhoneListController($http) {...}
      PhoneListController.$inject = ['$http'];
      ...
      .component('phoneList', {..., controller: PhoneListController});
  ```

* Use an inline annotation where, instead of just providing the function, you provide an array.
  This array contains a list of the service names, followed by the function itself as the last item
  of the array.

  ```js
      function PhoneListController($http) {...}
      ...
      .component('phoneList', {..., controller: ['$http', PhoneListController]});
  ```

Both of these methods work with any function that can be injected by AngularJS, so it's up to your
project's style guide to decide which one you use.

When using the second method, it is common to provide the constructor function inline, when
registering the controller:

```js
.component('phoneList', {..., controller: ['$http', function PhoneListController($http) {...}]});
```

From this point onwards, we are going to use the inline method in the tutorial. With that in mind,
let's add the annotations to our `PhoneListController`:

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js`**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneList').
    component('phoneList', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',
      controller: ['$http',
        function PhoneListController($http) {
          var self = this;
          self.orderProp = 'age';

          $http.get('phones/phones.json').then(function(response) {
            self.phones = response.data;
          });
        }
      ]
    });
```


## Testing

Because we started using dependency injection and our controller has dependencies, constructing the
controller in our tests is a bit more complicated. We could use the `new` operator and provide the
constructor with some kind of fake `$http` implementation. However, AngularJS provides a mock `$http`
service that we can use in unit tests.  We configure "fake" responses to server requests by calling
methods on a service called `$httpBackend`:

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('phoneList', function() {

  beforeEach(module('phoneList'));

  describe('controller', function() {
    var $httpBackend, ctrl;

    // The injector ignores leading and trailing underscores here (i.e. _$httpBackend_).
    // This allows us to inject a service and assign it to a variable with the same name
    // as the service while avoiding a name conflict.
    beforeEach(inject(function($componentController, _$httpBackend_) {
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
      $httpBackend.expectGET('phones/phones.json')
                  .respond([{name: 'Nexus S'}, {name: 'Motorola DROID'}]);

      ctrl = $componentController('phoneList');
    }));

    ...

  });

});
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **Note:** Because we loaded Jasmine and `angular-mocks.js` in our test environment, we got two
  helper methods {@link angular.mock.module module} and {@link angular.mock.inject inject} that we
  can use to access and configure the injector.
</div>

We created the controller in the test environment, as follows:

* We used the `inject()` helper method to inject instances of
  {@link ngMock.$componentController $componentController} and {@link ng.$httpBackend $httpBackend}
  services into Jasmine's `beforeEach()` function. These instances come from an injector which is
  recreated from scratch for every single test. This guarantees that each test starts from a well
  known starting point and each test is isolated from the work done in other tests.

* We called the injected `$componentController` function passing the name of the `phoneList`
  component (whose controller we wanted to instantiate) as a parameter.

Because our code now uses the `$http` service to fetch the phone list data in our controller, before
we create the `PhoneListController`, we need to tell the testing harness to expect an incoming
request from the controller. To do this we:

* Inject the `$httpBackend` service into the `beforeEach()` function. This is a
  {@link ngMock.$httpBackend mock version} of the service that in a production environment
  facilitates all XHR and JSONP requests. The mock version of this service allows us to write tests
  without having to deal with native APIs and the global state associated with them — both of which
  make testing a nightmare. It also overcomes the asynchronous nature of these calls, which would
  slow down unit tests.

* Use the `$httpBackend.expectGET()` method to train the `$httpBackend` service to expect an
  incoming HTTP request and tell it what to respond with. Note that the responses are not returned
  until we call the `$httpBackend.flush()` method.

Now we will make assertions to verify that the `phones` property doesn't exist on the controller
before the response is received:

```js
    it('should create a `phones` property with 2 phones fetched with `$http`', function() {
      expect(ctrl.phones).toBeUndefined();

      $httpBackend.flush();
      expect(ctrl.phones).toEqual([{name: 'Nexus S'}, {name: 'Motorola DROID'}]);
    });
```

* We flush the request queue in the browser by calling `$httpBackend.flush()`. This causes the
  promise returned by the `$http` service to be resolved with the trained response. See
  {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flushing-http-requests Flushing HTTP requests} in the mock
  `$httpBackend` documentation for a full explanation of why this is necessary.

* We make the assertions, verifying that the `phones` property now exists on the controller.

Finally, we verify that the default value of `orderProp` is set correctly:

```js
    it('should set a default value for the `orderProp` property', function() {
      expect(ctrl.orderProp).toBe('age');
    });
```

You should now see the following output in the Karma tab:

```
Chrome 49.0: Executed 2 of 2 SUCCESS (0.133 secs / 0.097 secs)
```


## Experiments

<div></div>

* At the bottom of `phone-list.template.html`, add a
  `<pre>{{$ctrl.phones | filter:$ctrl.query | orderBy:$ctrl.orderProp | json}}</pre>` binding to see
  the list of phones displayed in JSON format.

* In the `PhoneListController` controller, pre-process the HTTP response by limiting the number of
  phones to the first 5 in the list. Use the following code in the `$http` callback:

  ```js
  self.phones = response.data.slice(0, 5);
  ```


## Summary

Now that you have learned how easy it is to use AngularJS services (thanks to AngularJS's dependency
injection), go to {@link step_08 step 8}, where you will add some thumbnail images of phones and
some links.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="7"></ul>


[minification]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)


---

## tutorial/step_08.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 8 - Templating Links & Images
@step 8
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="8"></ul>


In this step, we will add thumbnail images for the phones in the phone list, and links that, for
now, will go nowhere. In subsequent steps, we will use the links to display additional information
about the phones in the catalog.

* There are now links and images of the phones in the list.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="8"></div>


## Data

Note that the `phones.json` file contains unique IDs and image URLs for each of the phones. The
URLs point to the `app/img/phones/` directory.

<br />
**`app/phones/phones.json`** (sample snippet):

```json
[
  {
    ...
    "id": "motorola-defy-with-motoblur",
    "imageUrl": "img/phones/motorola-defy-with-motoblur.0.jpg",
    "name": "Motorola DEFY\u2122 with MOTOBLUR\u2122",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```


## Component Template

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html`:**

```html
...
<ul class="phones">
  <li ng-repeat="phone in $ctrl.phones | filter:$ctrl.query | orderBy:$ctrl.orderProp" class="thumbnail">
    <a href="#!/phones/{{phone.id}}" class="thumb">
      <img ng-src="{{phone.imageUrl}}" alt="{{phone.name}}" />
    </a>
    <a href="#!/phones/{{phone.id}}">{{phone.name}}</a>
    <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
  </li>
</ul>
...
```

To dynamically generate links that will in the future lead to phone detail pages, we used the
now-familiar double-curly brace binding in the `href` attribute values. In step 2, we added the
`{{phone.name}}` binding as the element content. In this step the `{{phone.id}}` binding is used in
the element attribute.

We also added phone images next to each record using an image tag with the {@link ngSrc ngSrc}
directive. That directive prevents the browser from treating the AngularJS `{{ expression }}` markup
literally, and initiating a request to an invalid URL (`http://localhost:8000/{{phone.imageUrl}}`),
which it would have done if we had only specified an attribute binding in a regular `src` attribute
(`<img src="{{phone.imageUrl}}">`). Using the `ngSrc` directive, prevents the browser from making an
HTTP request to an invalid location.


## Testing

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`**:

```js
    ...

    it('should render phone specific links', function() {
      var query = element(by.model('$ctrl.query'));
      query.sendKeys('nexus');

      element.all(by.css('.phones li a')).first().click();
      expect(browser.getCurrentUrl()).toContain('index.html#!/phones/nexus-s');
    });

    ...
```

We added a new E2E test to verify that the application is generating correct links to the phone
views, that we will implement in the upcoming steps.

You can now rerun `npm run protractor` to see the tests run.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Replace the `ngSrc` directive with a plain old `src` attribute. Using tools such as your browser's
  developer tools or inspecting the web server access logs, confirm that the application is indeed
  making an extraneous request to `%7B%7Bphone.imageUrl%7D%7D` (or `{{phone.imageUrl}}`).

  The issue here is that the browser will fire a request for that invalid image address as soon as
  it hits the `<img>` tag, which is before AngularJS has a chance to evaluate the expression and
  inject the valid address.


## Summary

Now that you have added phone images and links, go to {@link step_09 step 9} to learn about
AngularJS layout templates and how AngularJS makes it easy to create applications that have
multiple views.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="8"></ul>


---

## tutorial/step_09.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 9 - Routing & Multiple Views
@step 9
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="9"></ul>


In this step, you will learn how to create a layout template and how to build an application that
has multiple views by adding routing, using an AngularJS module called {@link ngRoute ngRoute}.

* When you now navigate to `/index.html`, you are redirected to `/index.html#!/phones` and the phone
  list appears in the browser.
* When you click on a phone link, the URL changes to that specific phone and the stub of a phone
  detail page is displayed.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="9"></div>


## Dependencies

The routing functionality added in this step is provided by AngularJS in the `ngRoute` module, which
is distributed separately from the core AngularJS framework.

Since we are using [npm][npm] to install client-side dependencies, this step updates the
`package.json` configuration file to include the new dependency:

<br />
**`package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "angular-phonecat",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.8.x",
    "angular-route": "1.8.x",
    "bootstrap": "3.3.x"
  },
  ...
}
```

The new dependency `"angular-route": "1.8.x"` tells npm to install a version of the angular-route
module that is compatible with version 1.8.x of AngularJS. We must tell npm to download and install
this dependency.

```
npm install
```


## Multiple Views, Routing and Layout Templates

Our app is slowly growing and becoming more complex. Prior to this step, the app provided our users
with a single view (including the list of all phones), and all of the template code was located in
the `phone-list.template.html` file. The next step in building the application is to add a view that
will show detailed information about each of the devices in our list.

To add the detailed view, we are going to turn `index.html` into what we call a "layout template".
This is a template that is common for all views in our application. Other "partial templates" are
then included into this layout template depending on the current "route" — the view that is
currently displayed to the user.

Application routes in AngularJS are declared via the {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider},
which is the provider of the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. This service makes it easy to
wire together controllers, view templates, and the current URL location in the browser. Using this
feature, we can implement [deep linking][deep-linking], which lets us utilize the browser's history
(back and forward navigation) and bookmarks.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <p>
    `ngRoute` lets us associate a controller and a template with a specific URL (or URL
    pattern). This is pretty close to what we did with `ngController` and `index.html` back in
    {@link step_02 step 2}.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we have already learned that components allow us to combine controllers with templates in
    a modular, testable way, we are going to use components for routing as well.
    Each route will be associated with a component and that component will be in charge of providing
    the view template and the controller.
  </p>
</div>


### A Note about DI, Injector and Providers

As you {@link step_07 noticed}, {@link guide/di dependency injection} (DI) is at the core of
AngularJS, so it's important for you to understand a thing or two about how it works.

When the application bootstraps, AngularJS creates an injector that will be used to find and inject
all of the services that are required by your application. The injector itself doesn't know anything
about what the `$http` or `$route` services do. In fact, the injector doesn't even know about the
existence of these services, unless it is configured with proper module definitions.

The injector only carries out the following steps:

* Load the module definition(s) that you specify in your application.
* Register all Providers defined in these module definition(s).
* When asked to do so, lazily instantiate services and their dependencies, via their Providers, as
  parameters to an injectable function.

Providers are objects that provide (create) instances of services and expose configuration APIs,
that can be used to control the creation and runtime behavior of a service. In case of the `$route`
service, the `$routeProvider` exposes APIs that allow you to define routes for your application.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  **Note:** Providers can only be injected into `config` functions. Thus you could not inject
  `$routeProvider` into `PhoneListController` at runtime.
</div>

AngularJS modules solve the problem of removing global variables from the application and provide a
way of configuring the injector. As opposed to AMD or require.js modules, AngularJS modules don't
try to solve the problem of script load ordering or lazy script fetching. These goals are totally
independent and both module systems can live side-by-side and fulfill their goals.

To deepen your understanding on AngularJS's DI, see [Understanding Dependency Injection][wiki-di].


## Template

The `$route` service is usually used in conjunction with the {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}
directive. The role of the `ngView` directive is to include the view template for the current route
into the layout template. This makes it a perfect fit for our `index.html` template.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="lib/angular-route/angular-route.js"></script>
  <script src="app.module.js"></script>
  <script src="app.config.js"></script>
  ...
  <script src="phone-detail/phone-detail.module.js"></script>
  <script src="phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <div ng-view></div>

</body>
```

We have added four new `<script>` tags in our `index.html` file to load some extra JavaScript files
into our application:

* `angular-route.js`: Defines the AngularJS `ngRoute` module, which provides us with routing.
* `app.config.js`: Configures the providers available to our main module (see
  [below](tutorial/step_09#configuring-a-module)).
* `phone-detail.module.js`: Defines a new module containing a `phoneDetail` component.
* `phone-detail.component.js`: Defines a dummy `phoneDetail` component (see
  [below](tutorial/step_09#the-phonedetail-component)).

Note that we removed the `<phone-list></phone-list>` line from the `index.html` template and
replaced it with a `<div>` with the `ng-view` attribute.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_09.png">


## Configuring a Module

A module's {@link ng.angular.Module#config .config()} method gives us access to the available
providers for configuration. To make the providers, services and directives defined in `ngRoute`
available to our application, we need to add `ngRoute` as a dependency of our `phonecatApp` module.

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  'ngRoute',
  ...
]);
```

Now, in addition to the core services and directives, we can also configure the `$route` service
(using its provider) for our application. In order to be able to quickly locate the configuration
code, we put it into a separate file and used the `.config` suffix.

<br />
**`app/app.config.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phonecatApp').
    config(['$routeProvider',
      function config($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider.
          when('/phones', {
            template: '<phone-list></phone-list>'
          }).
          when('/phones/:phoneId', {
            template: '<phone-detail></phone-detail>'
          }).
          otherwise('/phones');
      }
    ]);
```

Using the `.config()` method, we request the necessary providers (for example the `$routeProvider`)
to be injected into our configuration function and then use their methods to specify the behavior of
the corresponding services. Here, we use the
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#when $routeProvider.when()} and
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#otherwise $routeProvider.otherwise()} methods to define our
application routes.

Our routes are defined as follows:

* `when('/phones')`: Determines the view that will be shown, when the URL hash fragment is
  `/phones`. According to the specified template, AngularJS will create an instance of the `phoneList`
  component to manage the view. Note that this is the same markup that we used to have in the
  `index.html` file.

* `when('/phones/:phoneId')`: Determines the view that will be shown, when the URL hash fragment
  matches `/phones/<phoneId>`, where `<phoneId>` is a variable part of the URL. In charge of the
  view will be the `phoneDetail` component.

* `otherwise('/phones')`: Defines a fallback route to redirect to, when no route definition matches
  the current URL.(Here it will redirect to `/phones`.)

We reused the `phoneList` component that we have already built and a new "dummy" `phoneDetail`
component. For now, the `phoneDetail` component will just display the selected phone's ID.
(Not too impressive, but we will enhance it in the {@link step_10 next step}.)

Note the use of the `:phoneId` parameter in the second route declaration. The `$route` service uses
the route declaration — `'/phones/:phoneId'` — as a template that is matched against the current
URL. All variables defined with the `:` prefix are extracted into the (injectable)
{@link ngRoute.$routeParams $routeParams} object.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    You may have noticed, that &mdash; while the configured route paths start with `/` (e.g.
    `/phones`) &mdash; the URLs used in templates start with `#!/` (e.g. `#!/phones`).
  </p>
  <p>
    Without getting into much detail, AngularJS (by default) uses the hash part of the URL (i.e.
    what comes after the hash (`#`) symbol) to determine the current route. In addition to that, you
    can also specify a {@link $locationProvider#hashPrefix hash-prefix} (`!` by default) that needs
    to appear after the hash symbol in order for AngularJS to consider the value an "AngularJS path"
    and process it (for example, try to match it to a route).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find out more about how all this works in the [Using $location](guide/$location) section
    of the Developer Guide. But all you need to know for now, is that the URLs to our various routes
    should be prefixed with `#!`.
  </p>
</div>


## The `phoneDetail` Component

We created a `phoneDetail` component to handle the phone details view. We followed the same
conventions as with `phoneList`, using a separate directory and creating a `phoneDetail` module,
which we added as a dependency of the `phonecatApp` module.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phoneDetail', [
  'ngRoute'
]);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneDetail').
    component('phoneDetail', {
      template: 'TBD: Detail view for <span>{{$ctrl.phoneId}}</span>',
      controller: ['$routeParams',
        function PhoneDetailController($routeParams) {
          this.phoneId = $routeParams.phoneId;
        }
      ]
    });
```

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  ...
  'phoneDetail',
  ...
]);
```

### A Note on Sub-module Dependencies

The `phoneDetail` module depends on the `ngRoute` module for providing the `$routeParams` object,
which is used in the `phoneDetail` component's controller. Since `ngRoute` is also a dependency of
the main `phonecatApp` module, its services and directives are already available everywhere in the
application (including the `phoneDetail` component).

This means that our application would continue to work even if we didn't include `ngRoute` in the
list of dependencies for the `phoneDetail` component. Although it might be tempting to omit
dependencies of a sub-module that are already imported by the main module, it breaks our hard-earned
modularity.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Imagine what would happen if we decided to copy the `phoneDetail` feature over to another project
  that does not declare a dependency on `ngRoute`. The injector would not be able to provide
  `$routeParams` and our application would break.
</div>

The takeaway here is:

* Always be explicit about the dependencies of a sub-module. Do not rely on dependencies inherited
  from a parent module (because that parent module might not be there some day).

<div class="alert alert-success">
  Declaring the same dependency in multiple modules does not incur extra "cost", because AngularJS
  will still load each dependency once. For more info on modules and their dependencies take a look
  at the [Modules](guide/module) section of the Developer Guide.
</div>


## Testing

Since some of our modules depend on {@link ngRoute ngRoute} now, it is necessary to update the Karma
configuration file with angular-route. Other than that, the unit tests should (still) pass without
any modification.

<br />
**`karma.conf.js`:**

```js
    files: [
      'lib/angular/angular.js',
      'lib/angular-route/angular-route.js',
      ...
    ],
```

<br />
To automatically verify that everything is wired properly, we wrote E2E tests for navigating to
various URLs and verifying that the correct view was rendered.

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`**

```js
  ...

  it('should redirect `index.html` to `index.html#!/phones', function() {
    browser.get('index.html');
    expect(browser.getCurrentUrl()).toContain('index.html#!/phones');
  });

  ...

  describe('View: Phone list', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html#!/phones');
    });

    ...

  });

  ...

  describe('View: Phone details', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html#!/phones/nexus-s');
    });

    it('should display placeholder page with `phoneId`', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding('$ctrl.phoneId')).getText()).toBe('nexus-s');
    });

  });

  ...
```

You can now rerun `npm run protractor` to see the tests run (and hopefully pass).


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Try to add a `{{$ctrl.phoneId}}` binding in the template string for the phone details view:

  ```js
  when('/phones/:phoneId', {
    template: '{{$ctrl.phoneId}} <phone-detail></phone-detail>'
  ...
  ```

  You will see that nothing happens, even when you are in the phone details view. This is because
  the `phoneId` model is visible only in the context set by the `phoneDetail` component. Again,
  component isolation at work!


## Summary

With the routing set up and the phone list view implemented, we are ready to go to
{@link step_10 step 10} and implement a proper phone details view.

## tutorial/step_10.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 10 - More Templating
@step 10
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="10"></ul>


In this step, we will implement the phone details view, which is displayed when a user clicks on a
phone in the phone list.

* When you click on a phone on the list, the phone details page with phone-specific information is
  displayed.

To implement the phone details view we are going to use {@link ng.$http $http} to fetch our data,
and then flesh out the `phoneDetail` component's template.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="10"></div>


## Data

In addition to `phones.json`, the `app/phones/` directory also contains one JSON file for each
phone:

<br />
**`app/phones/nexus-s.json`:** (sample snippet)

```json
{
  "additionalFeatures": "Contour Display, Near Field Communications (NFC), ...",
  "android": {
    "os": "Android 2.3",
    "ui": "Android"
  },
  ...
  "images": [
    "img/phones/nexus-s.0.jpg",
    "img/phones/nexus-s.1.jpg",
    "img/phones/nexus-s.2.jpg",
    "img/phones/nexus-s.3.jpg"
  ],
  "storage": {
    "flash": "16384MB",
    "ram": "512MB"
  }
}
```

Each of these files describes various properties of the phone using the same data structure. We will
show this data in the phone details view.


## Component Controller

We will expand the `phoneDetail` component's controller by using the `$http` service to fetch the
appropriate JSON files. This works the same way as the `phoneList` component's controller.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneDetail').
    component('phoneDetail', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html',
      controller: ['$http', '$routeParams',
        function PhoneDetailController($http, $routeParams) {
          var self = this;

          $http.get('phones/' + $routeParams.phoneId + '.json').then(function(response) {
            self.phone = response.data;
          });
        }
      ]
    });
```

To construct the URL for the HTTP request, we use `$routeParams.phoneId`, which is extracted from
the current route by the `$route` service.


## Component Template

The inline, TBD placeholder template has been replaced with a full blown external template,
including lists and bindings that comprise the phone details. Note how we use the AngularJS
`{{expression}}` markup and `ngRepeat` to project phone data from our model into the view.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html`:**

```html
<img ng-src="{{$ctrl.phone.images[0]}}" class="phone" />

<h1>{{$ctrl.phone.name}}</h1>

<p>{{$ctrl.phone.description}}</p>

<ul class="phone-thumbs">
  <li ng-repeat="img in $ctrl.phone.images">
    <img ng-src="{{img}}" />
  </li>
</ul>

<ul class="specs">
  <li>
    <span>Availability and Networks</span>
    <dl>
      <dt>Availability</dt>
      <dd ng-repeat="availability in $ctrl.phone.availability">{{availability}}</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  ...
  <li>
    <span>Additional Features</span>
    <dd>{{$ctrl.phone.additionalFeatures}}</dd>
  </li>
</ul>
```

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_10.png">


## Testing

We wrote a new unit test that is similar to the one we wrote for the `phoneList` component's
controller in {@link step_07#testing step 7}.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('phoneDetail', function() {

  // Load the module that contains the `phoneDetail` component before each test
  beforeEach(module('phoneDetail'));

  // Test the controller
  describe('PhoneDetailController', function() {
    var $httpBackend, ctrl;

    beforeEach(inject(function($componentController, _$httpBackend_, $routeParams) {
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
      $httpBackend.expectGET('phones/xyz.json').respond({name: 'phone xyz'});

      $routeParams.phoneId = 'xyz';

      ctrl = $componentController('phoneDetail');
    }));

    it('should fetch the phone details', function() {
      expect(ctrl.phone).toBeUndefined();

      $httpBackend.flush();
      expect(ctrl.phone).toEqual({name: 'phone xyz'});
    });

  });

});
```

You should now see the following output in the Karma tab:

```
Chrome 49.0: Executed 3 of 3 SUCCESS (0.159 secs / 0.136 secs)
```

We also added a new E2E test that navigates to the 'Nexus S' details page and verifies that the
heading on the page is "Nexus S".

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`**

```js
  ...

  describe('View: Phone detail', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html#!/phones/nexus-s');
    });

    it('should display the `nexus-s` page', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding('$ctrl.phone.name')).getText()).toBe('Nexus S');
    });

  });

  ...
```

You can run the tests with `npm run protractor`.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Using [Protractor's API][protractor-docs], write a test that verifies that we display 4 thumbnail
  images on the 'Nexus S' details page.


## Summary

Now that the phone details view is in place, proceed to {@link step_11 step 11} to learn how to
write your own custom display filter.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="10"></ul>


[protractor-docs]: https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api


---

## tutorial/step_11.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 11 - Custom Filters
@step 11
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="11"></ul>


In this step you will learn how to create your own custom display filter.

* In the previous step, the details page displayed either "true" or "false" to indicate whether
  certain phone features were present or not. In this step, we are using a custom filter to convert
  those text strings into glyphs: ✓ for "true", and ✘ for "false".

Let's see what the filter code looks like.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="11"></div>


## The `checkmark` Filter

Since this filter is generic (i.e. it is not specific to any view or component), we are going to
register it in a `core` module, which contains "application-wide" features.

<br />
**`app/core/core.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('core', []);
```

<br />
**`app/core/checkmark/checkmark.filter.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('core').
    filter('checkmark', function() {
      return function(input) {
        return input ? '\u2713' : '\u2718';
      };
    });
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  As you may have noticed, we (unsurprisingly) gave our file a `.filter` suffix.
</div>

The name of our filter is "checkmark". The `input` evaluates to either `true` or `false`, and we
return one of the two unicode characters we have chosen to represent true (`\u2713` -> ✓) and false
(`\u2718` -> ✘).

Now that our filter is ready, we need to register the `core` module as a dependency of our main
`phonecatApp` module.

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  ...
  'core',
  ...
]);
```


## Templates

Since we have created two new files (**core.module.js**, **checkmark.filter.js**), we need to
include them in our layout template.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
    ...
    <script src="core/core.module.js"></script>
    <script src="core/checkmark/checkmark.filter.js"></script>
    ...
```

The syntax for using filters in AngularJS templates is as follows:

```
{{expression | filter}}
```

Let's employ the filter in the phone details template:

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html`:**

```html
    ...
    <dl>
      <dt>Infrared</dt>
      <dd>{{$ctrl.phone.connectivity.infrared | checkmark}}</dd>
      <dt>GPS</dt>
      <dd>{{$ctrl.phone.connectivity.gps | checkmark}}</dd>
    </dl>
    ...
```


## Testing

Filters, like any other code, should be tested. Luckily, these tests are very easy to write.

<br />
**`app/core/checkmark/checkmark.filter.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('checkmark', function() {

  beforeEach(module('core'));

  it('should convert boolean values to unicode checkmark or cross',
    inject(function(checkmarkFilter) {
      expect(checkmarkFilter(true)).toBe('\u2713');
      expect(checkmarkFilter(false)).toBe('\u2718');
    })
  );

});
```

The call to `beforeEach(module('core'))` loads the `core` module (which contains the `checkmark`
filter) into the injector, before every test.

Note that we call the helper function `inject(function(checkmarkFilter) {...})`, to get access to
the filter that we want to test. See also {@link angular.mock.inject angular.mock.inject()}.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  When injecting a filter, we need to suffix the filter name with 'Filter'. For example, our
  `checkmark` filter is injected as `checkmarkFilter`.
  See the [Filters](guide/filter#using-filters-in-controllers-services-and-directives) section of
  the Developer Guide for more info.
</div>

You should now see the following output in the Karma tab:

```
Chrome 49.0: Executed 4 of 4 SUCCESS (0.091 secs / 0.075 secs)
```


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Let's experiment with some of the {@link api/ng/filter built-in AngularJS filters}.
  Add the following bindings to `index.html`:

  * `{{'lower cap string' | uppercase}}`
  * `{{{foo: 'bar', baz: 42} | json}}`
  * `{{1459461289000 | date}}`
  * `{{1459461289000 | date:'MM/dd/yyyy @ h:mma'}}`


* We can also create a model with an input element, and combine it with a filtered binding.
  Add the following to `index.html`:

  ```html
  <input ng-model="userInput" /> Uppercased: {{userInput | uppercase}}
  ```


## Summary

Now that we have learned how to write and test a custom filter, let's go to {@link step_12 step 12}
to learn how we can use AngularJS to enhance the phone details page further.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="11"></ul>


---

## tutorial/step_12.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 12 - Event Handlers
@step 12
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="12"></ul>


In this step, you will add a clickable phone image swapper to the phone details page.

* The phone details view displays one large image of the current phone and several smaller thumbnail
  images. It would be great if we could replace the large image with any of the thumbnails just by
  clicking on the desired thumbnail image. Let's have a look at how we can do this with AngularJS.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="12"></div>


## Component Controller

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js`:**

```js
    ...
    controller: ['$http', '$routeParams',
      function PhoneDetailController($http, $routeParams) {
        var self = this;

        self.setImage = function setImage(imageUrl) {
          self.mainImageUrl = imageUrl;
        };

        $http.get('phones/' + $routeParams.phoneId + '.json').then(function(response) {
          self.phone = response.data;
          self.setImage(self.phone.images[0]);
        });
      }
    ]
    ...
```

In the `phoneDetail` component's controller, we created the `mainImageUrl` model property and set
its default value to the first phone image URL.

We also created a `setImage()` method (to be used as event handler), that will change the value of
`mainImageUrl`.


## Component Template

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html`:**

```html
<img ng-src="{{$ctrl.mainImageUrl}}" class="phone" />
...
<ul class="phone-thumbs">
  <li ng-repeat="img in $ctrl.phone.images">
    <img ng-src="{{img}}" ng-click="$ctrl.setImage(img)" />
  </li>
</ul>
...
```

We bound the `ngSrc` directive of the large image to the `$ctrl.mainImageUrl` property.

We also registered an {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} handler with thumbnail images. When a
user clicks on one of the thumbnail images, the handler will use the `$ctrl.setImage()` method
callback to change the value of the `$ctrl.mainImageUrl` property to the URL of the clicked
thumbnail image.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_12.png">


## Testing

To verify this new feature, we added two E2E tests. One verifies that `mainImageUrl` is set to the
first phone image URL by default. The second test clicks on several thumbnail images and verifies
that the main image URL changes accordingly.

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`:**

```js
  ...

  describe('View: Phone detail', function() {

    ...

    it('should display the first phone image as the main phone image', function() {
      var mainImage = element(by.css('img.phone'));

      expect(mainImage.getAttribute('src')).toMatch(/img\/phones\/nexus-s.0.jpg/);
    });

    it('should swap the main image when clicking on a thumbnail image', function() {
      var mainImage = element(by.css('img.phone'));
      var thumbnails = element.all(by.css('.phone-thumbs img'));

      thumbnails.get(2).click();
      expect(mainImage.getAttribute('src')).toMatch(/img\/phones\/nexus-s.2.jpg/);

      thumbnails.get(0).click();
      expect(mainImage.getAttribute('src')).toMatch(/img\/phones\/nexus-s.0.jpg/);
    });

  });

  ...
```

You can now rerun the tests with `npm run protractor`.

We also have to refactor one of our unit tests, because of the addition of the `mainImageUrl` model
property to the controller. As previously, we will use a mocked response.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.spec.js`:**

```js
  ...

  describe('controller', function() {
    var $httpBackend, ctrl
    var xyzPhoneData = {
      name: 'phone xyz',
      images: ['image/url1.png', 'image/url2.png']
    };

    beforeEach(inject(function($componentController, _$httpBackend_, _$routeParams_) {
      $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;
      $httpBackend.expectGET('phones/xyz.json').respond(xyzPhoneData);

      ...
    }));

    it('should fetch phone details', function() {
      expect(ctrl.phone).toBeUndefined();

      $httpBackend.flush();
      expect(ctrl.phone).toEqual(xyzPhoneData);
    });

  });

  ...
```

Our unit tests should now be passing again.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Similar to the `ngClick` directive, which binds an AngularJS expression to the `click` event, there
  are built-in directives for all native events, such as `dblclick`, `focus`/`blur`, mouse and key
  events, etc.

  Let's add a new controller method to the `phoneDetail` component's controller:

  ```js
  self.onDblclick = function onDblclick(imageUrl) {
    alert('You double-clicked image: ' + imageUrl);
  };
  ```

  and add the following to the `<img>` element in `phone-detail.template.html`:

  ```html
  <img ... ng-dblclick="$ctrl.onDblclick(img)" />
  ```

  Now, whenever you double-click on a thumbnail, an alert pops-up. Pretty annoying!


## Summary

With the phone image swapper in place, we are ready for {@link step_13 step 13} to learn an even
better way to fetch data.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="12"></ul>


---

## tutorial/step_13.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 13 - REST and Custom Services
@step 13
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="13"></ul>


In this step, we will change the way our application fetches data.

* We define a custom service that represents a [RESTful][restful] client. Using this client we can
  make requests for data to the server in an easier way, without having to deal with the lower-level
  {@link ng.$http $http} API, HTTP methods and URLs.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="13"></div>


## Dependencies

The RESTful functionality is provided by AngularJS in the {@link ngResource ngResource} module, which
is distributed separately from the core AngularJS framework.

Since we are using [npm][npm] to install client-side dependencies, this step updates the
`package.json` configuration file to include the new dependency:

<br />
**`package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "angular-phonecat",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.8.x",
    "angular-resource": "1.8.x",
    "angular-route": "1.8.x",
    "bootstrap": "3.3.x"
  },
  ...
}
```

The new dependency `"angular-resource": "1.8.x"` tells npm to install a version of the
angular-resource module that is compatible with version 1.8.x of AngularJS. We must tell npm to
download and install this dependency.

```
npm install
```


## Service

We create our own service to provide access to the phone data on the server. We will put the service
in its own module, under `core`, so we can explicitly declare its dependency on `ngResource`:

<br />
**`app/core/phone/phone.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('core.phone', ['ngResource']);
```

<br />
**`app/core/phone/phone.service.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('core.phone').
    factory('Phone', ['$resource',
      function($resource) {
        return $resource('phones/:phoneId.json', {}, {
          query: {
            method: 'GET',
            params: {phoneId: 'phones'},
            isArray: true
          }
        });
      }
    ]);
```

We used the {@link angular.Module module API} to register a custom service using a factory function.
We passed in the name of the service &mdash; `'Phone'` &mdash; and the factory function. The factory
function is similar to a controller's constructor in that both can declare dependencies to be
injected via function arguments. The `Phone` service declares a dependency on the `$resource`
service, provided by the `ngResource` module.

The {@link ngResource.$resource $resource} service makes it easy to create a [RESTful][restful]
client with just a few lines of code. This client can then be used in our application, instead of
the lower-level {@link ng.$http $http} service.

<br />
**`app/core/core.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('core', ['core.phone']);
```

We need to add the `core.phone` module as a dependency of the `core` module.


## Template

Our custom resource service will be defined in `app/core/phone/phone.service.js`, so we need to
include this file and the associated `.module.js` file in our layout template. Additionally, we also
need to load the `angular-resource.js` file, which contains the `ngResource` module:

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="lib/angular-resource/angular-resource.js"></script>
  ...
  <script src="core/phone/phone.module.js"></script>
  <script src="core/phone/phone.service.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
```


## Component Controllers

We can now simplify our component controllers (`PhoneListController` and `PhoneDetailController`) by
factoring out the lower-level `$http` service, replacing it with the new `Phone` service.
AngularJS's `$resource` service is easier to use than `$http` for interacting with data sources
exposed as RESTful resources. It is also easier now to understand what the code in our controllers
is doing.

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phoneList', ['core.phone']);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneList').
    component('phoneList', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-list/phone-list.template.html',
      controller: ['Phone',
        function PhoneListController(Phone) {
          this.phones = Phone.query();
          this.orderProp = 'age';
        }
      ]
    });
```

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phoneDetail', [
  'ngRoute',
  'core.phone'
]);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneDetail').
    component('phoneDetail', {
      templateUrl: 'phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html',
      controller: ['$routeParams', 'Phone',
        function PhoneDetailController($routeParams, Phone) {
          var self = this;
          self.phone = Phone.get({phoneId: $routeParams.phoneId}, function(phone) {
            self.setImage(phone.images[0]);
          });

          self.setImage = function setImage(imageUrl) {
            self.mainImageUrl = imageUrl;
          };
        }
      ]
    });
```

Notice how in `PhoneListController` we replaced:

```js
$http.get('phones/phones.json').then(function(response) {
  self.phones = response.data;
});
```

with just:

```js
this.phones = Phone.query();
```

This is a simple and declarative statement that we want to query for all phones.

An important thing to notice in the code above is that we don't pass any callback functions, when
invoking methods of our `Phone` service. Although it looks as if the results were returned
synchronously, that is not the case at all. What is returned synchronously is a "future" — an
object, which will be filled with data, when the XHR response is received. Because of the
data-binding in AngularJS, we can use this future and bind it to our template. Then, when the data
arrives, the view will be updated automatically.

Sometimes, relying on the future object and data-binding alone is not sufficient to do everything
we require, so in these cases, we can add a callback to process the server response. The
`phoneDetail` component's controller illustrates this by setting the `mainImageUrl` in a callback.


## Testing

Because we are now using the {@link ngResource ngResource} module, it is necessary to update the
Karma configuration file with angular-resource.

<br />
**`karma.conf.js`:**

```js
    files: [
      'lib/angular/angular.js',
      'lib/angular-resource/angular-resource.js',
      ...
    ],
```

We have added a unit test to verify that our new service is issuing HTTP requests and returns the
expected "future" objects/arrays.

The {@link ngResource.$resource $resource} service augments the response object with extra methods
&mdash; e.g. for updating and deleting the resource &mdash; and properties (some of which are only
meant to be accessed by AngularJS). If we were to use Jasmine's standard `.toEqual()` matcher, our
tests would fail, because the test values would not match the responses exactly.

To solve the  problem, we instruct Jasmine to use a [custom equality tester][jasmine-equality] for
comparing objects. We specify {@link angular.equals angular.equals} as our equality tester, which
ignores functions and `$`-prefixed properties, such as those added by the `$resource` service.<br />
(Remember that AngularJS uses the `$` prefix for its proprietary API.)

<br />
**`app/core/phone/phone.service.spec.js`:**

```js
describe('Phone', function() {
  ...
  var phonesData = [...];

  // Add a custom equality tester before each test
  beforeEach(function() {
    jasmine.addCustomEqualityTester(angular.equals);
  });

  // Load the module that contains the `Phone` service before each test
  ...

  // Instantiate the service and "train" `$httpBackend` before each test
  ...

  // Verify that there are no outstanding expectations or requests after each test
  afterEach(function () {
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingExpectation();
    $httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest();
  });

  it('should fetch the phones data from `/phones/phones.json`', function() {
    var phones = Phone.query();

    expect(phones).toEqual([]);

    $httpBackend.flush();
    expect(phones).toEqual(phonesData);
  });

});
```

Here we are using `$httpBackend`'s
{@link ngMock.$httpBackend#verifyNoOutstandingExpectation verifyNoOutstandingExpectation()} and
{@link ngMock.$httpBackend#verifyNoOutstandingExpectation verifyNoOutstandingRequest()} methods to
verify that all expected requests have been sent and that no extra request is scheduled for later.

Note that we have also modified our component tests to use the custom matcher when appropriate.

You should now see the following output in the Karma tab:

```
Chrome 49.0: Executed 5 of 5 SUCCESS (0.123 secs / 0.104 secs)
```


## Summary

Now that we have seen how to build a custom service as a RESTful client, we are ready for
{@link step_14 step 14} to learn how to enhance the user experience with animations.

## tutorial/step_14.ngdoc

@ngdoc tutorial
@name 14 - Animations
@step 14
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="14"></ul>


In this step, we will enhance our web application by adding CSS and JavaScript animations on top of
the template code we created earlier.

* We now use the {@link ngAnimate ngAnimate} module to enable animations throughout the application.
* We also rely on built-in directives to automatically trigger hooks for animations to tap into.
* When an animation is found, it will run along with the actual DOM operation that is being issued
  on the element at the given time (e.g. inserting/removing nodes on {@link ngRepeat ngRepeat} or
  adding/removing classes on {@link ngClass ngClass}).


<div doc-tutorial-reset="14"></div>


## Dependencies

The animation functionality is provided by AngularJS in the `ngAnimate` module, which is distributed
separately from the core AngularJS framework. In addition we will use [jQuery][jquery] in this
project to do extra JavaScript animations.

Since we are using [npm][npm] to install client-side dependencies, this step updates the
`package.json` configuration file to include the new dependencies:

<br />
**`package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "angular-phonecat",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.8.x",
    "angular-animate": "1.8.x",
    "angular-resource": "1.8.x",
    "angular-route": "1.8.x",
    "bootstrap": "3.3.x",
    "jquery": "^3.5.1"
  },
  ...
}
```

* `"angular-animate": "1.8.x"` tells npm to install a version of the angular-animate module that
  is compatible with version 1.8.x of AngularJS.
* `"jquery": "^3.5.1"` tells npm to install a version of jQuery that is compatible with 3.5.x and at least 3.5.1.
  Note that this is not an AngularJS library; it is the standard jQuery library. We can use npm to
  install a wide range of 3rd party libraries.

Now, we must tell npm to download and install these dependencies.

```
npm install
```


## How Animations work with `ngAnimate`

To get an idea of how animations work with AngularJS, you might want to read the
[Animations](guide/animations) section of the Developer Guide first.


## Template

In order to enable animations, we need to update `index.html`, loading the necessary dependencies
(**angular-animate.js** and **jquery.js**) and the files that contain the CSS and JavaScript code
used in CSS/JavaScript animations. The animation module, {@link ngAnimate ngAnimate}, contains the
code necessary to make your application "animation aware".

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
  ...

  <!-- Defines CSS necessary for animations -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.animations.css" />

  ...

  <!-- Used for JavaScript animations (include this before angular.js) -->
  <script src="lib/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>

  ...

  <!-- Adds animation support in AngularJS -->
  <script src="lib/angular-animate/angular-animate.js"></script>

  <!-- Defines JavaScript animations -->
  <script src="app.animations.js"></script>

  ...
```

<div class="alert alert-error">
  **Important:** Be sure to use jQuery version 2.1 or newer, when using AngularJS 1.5 or newer;
  jQuery 1.x is not officially supported.
  In order for AngularJS to detect jQuery and take advantage of it, make sure to include `jquery.js`
  before `angular.js`.
</div>

Animations can now be created within the CSS code (`app.animations.css`) as well as the JavaScript
code (`app.animations.js`).


## Dependencies

We need to add a dependency on `ngAnimate` to our main module first:

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phonecatApp', [
      'ngAnimate',
      ...
    ]);
```

Now that our application is "animation aware", let's create some fancy animations!


## CSS Transition Animations: Animating `ngRepeat`

We will start off by adding CSS transition animations to our `ngRepeat` directive present on the
`phoneList` component's template. We need to add an extra CSS class to our repeated element, in
order to be able to hook into it with our CSS animation code.

<br />
**`app/phone-list/phone-list.template.html`:**

```html
...
<ul class="phones">
  <li ng-repeat="phone in $ctrl.phones | filter:$ctrl.query | orderBy:$ctrl.orderProp"
      class="thumbnail phone-list-item">
    <a href="#!/phones/{{phone.id}}" class="thumb">
      <img ng-src="{{phone.imageUrl}}" alt="{{phone.name}}" />
    </a>
    <a href="#!/phones/{{phone.id}}">{{phone.name}}</a>
    <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
  </li>
</ul>
...
```

Did you notice the added `phone-list-item` CSS class? This is all we need in our HTML code to get
animations working.

Now for the actual CSS transition animation code:

<br />
**`app/app.animations.css`:**

```css
.phone-list-item.ng-enter,
.phone-list-item.ng-leave,
.phone-list-item.ng-move {
  transition: 0.5s linear all;
}

.phone-list-item.ng-enter,
.phone-list-item.ng-move {
  height: 0;
  opacity: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.phone-list-item.ng-enter.ng-enter-active,
.phone-list-item.ng-move.ng-move-active {
  height: 120px;
  opacity: 1;
}

.phone-list-item.ng-leave {
  opacity: 1;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.phone-list-item.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
  height: 0;
  opacity: 0;
  padding-bottom: 0;
  padding-top: 0;
}
```

As you can see, our `phone-list-item` CSS class is combined together with the animation hooks that
occur when items are inserted into and removed from the list:

* The `ng-enter` class is applied to the element when a new phone is added to the list and rendered
  on the page.
* The `ng-move` class is applied to the element when a phone's relative position in the list
  changes.
* The `ng-leave` class is applied to the element when a phone is removed from the list.

The phone list items are added and removed based on the data passed to the `ngRepeat` directive.
For example, if the filter data changes, the items will be animated in and out of the repeat list.

Something important to note is that, when an animation occurs, two sets of CSS classes are added to
the element:

1. A "starting" class that represents the style at the beginning of the animation.
2. An "active" class that represents the style at the end of the animation.

The name of the starting class is the name of the event that is fired (like `enter`, `move` or
`leave`) prefixed with `ng-`. So an `enter` event will result in adding the `ng-enter` class.

The active class name is derived from the starting class by appending an `-active` suffix.
This two-class CSS naming convention allows the developer to craft an animation, beginning to end.

In the example above, animated elements are expanded from a height of **0px** to **120px** when they
are added to the list and are collapsed back down to **0px** before being removed from the list.
There is also a catchy fade-in/fade-out effect that occurs at the same time. All this is handled by
the CSS transition declaration at the top of the CSS file.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Although all modern browsers have good support for [CSS transitions][caniuse-css-transitions] and
  [CSS animations][caniuse-css-animation], IE9 and earlier IE versions do not.
  If you want animations that are backwards-compatible with older browsers, consider using
  JavaScript-based animations, which are demonstrated below.
</div>


## CSS Keyframe Animations: Animating `ngView`

Next, let's add an animation for transitions between route changes in
{@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}.

Again, we need to prepare our HTML template by adding a new CSS class, this time to the `ng-view`
element. In order to gain more "expressive power" for our animations, we will also wrap the
`[ng-view]` element in a container element.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<div class="view-container">
  <div ng-view class="view-frame"></div>
</div>
```

We have applied a `position: relative` CSS style to the `.view-container` wrapper, so that it is
easier for us to manage the `.view-frame` element's positioning during the animation.

With our preparation code in place, let's move on to the actual CSS styles for this transition
animation.

<br />
**`app/app.animations.css`:**

```css
...

.view-container {
  position: relative;
}

.view-frame.ng-enter,
.view-frame.ng-leave {
  background: white;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
}

.view-frame.ng-enter {
  animation: 1s fade-in;
  z-index: 100;
}

.view-frame.ng-leave {
  animation: 1s fade-out;
  z-index: 99;
}

@keyframes fade-in {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to   { opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes fade-out {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to   { opacity: 0; }
}

/* Older browsers might need vendor-prefixes for keyframes and animation! */
```

Nothing fancy here! Just a simple fade-in/fade-out effect between pages. The only thing out of the
ordinary here is that we are using absolute positioning to position the entering page (identified
by the `ng-enter` class) on top of the leaving page (identified by the `ng-leave` class). At the
same time a cross-fade animation is performed. So, as the previous page is just about to be removed,
it fades out, while the new page fades in right on top of it.

Once the `leave` animation is over, the element is removed from the DOM. Likewise, once the `enter`
animation is complete, the `ng-enter` and `ng-enter-active` CSS classes are removed from the
element, causing it to rerender and reposition itself with its default CSS styles (so no more
absolute positioning once the animation is over). This works fluidly and the pages flow naturally
between route changes, without anything jumping around.

The applied CSS classes are much the same as with `ngRepeat`. Each time a new page is loaded the
`ngView` directive will create a copy of itself, download the template and append the contents. This
ensures that all views are contained within a single HTML element, which allows for easy animation
control.

For more on CSS animations, see the [MDN web docs][mdn-animations].


## Animating `ngClass` with JavaScript

Let's add another animation to our application. On our `phone-detail.template.html` view, we have a
nice thumbnail swapper. By clicking on the thumbnails listed on the page, the profile phone image
changes. But how can we incorporate animations?

Let's give it some thought first. Basically, when a user clicks on a thumbnail image, they are
changing the state of the profile image to reflect the newly selected thumbnail image. The best way
to specify state changes within HTML is to use classes. Much like before &mdash; when we used a CSS
class to drive the animation &mdash; this time the animation will occur when the CSS class itself
changes.

Every time a phone thumbnail is selected, the state changes and the `.selected` CSS class is added
to the matching profile image. This will trigger the animation.

We will start by tweaking our HTML code in `phone-detail.template.html`. Notice that we have changed
the way we display our large image:

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.template.html`:**

```html
<div class="phone-images">
  <img ng-src="{{img}}" class="phone"
      ng-class="{selected: img === $ctrl.mainImageUrl}"
      ng-repeat="img in $ctrl.phone.images" />
</div>

...
```

Just like with the thumbnails, we are using a repeater to display **all** the profile images as a
list, however we're not animating any repeat-related transitions. Instead, we will be keeping our
eye on each element's classes and especially the `selected` class, since its presence or absence
will determine if the element is visible or hidden. The addition/removal of the `selected` class is
managed by the {@link ngClass ngClass} directive, based on the specified condition
(`img === $ctrl.mainImageUrl`).
In our case, there is always exactly one element that has the `selected` class, and therefore there
will be exactly one phone profile image visible on the screen at all times.

When the `selected` class is added to an element, the `selected-add` and `selected-add-active`
classes are added just before to signal AngularJS to fire off an animation. When the `selected`
class is removed from an element, the `selected-remove` and `selected-remove-active` classes are
applied to the element, triggering another animation.

Finally, in order to ensure that the phone images are displayed correctly when the page is first
loaded, we also tweak the detail page CSS styles:

<br />
**`app/app.css`:**

```css
...

.phone {
  background-color: white;
  display: none;
  float: left;
  height: 400px;
  margin-bottom: 2em;
  margin-right: 3em;
  padding: 2em;
  width: 400px;
}

.phone:first-child {
  display: block;
}

.phone-images {
  background-color: white;
  float: left;
  height: 450px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
  width: 450px;
}

...
```

You may be thinking that we are just going to create another CSS-based animation. Although we could
do that, let's take the opportunity to learn how to create JavaScript-based animations with the
{@link ng.angular.Module#animation .animation()} module method.

<br />
**`app/app.animations.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phonecatApp').
    animation('.phone', function phoneAnimationFactory() {
      return {
        addClass: animateIn,
        removeClass: animateOut
      };

      function animateIn(element, className, done) {
        if (className !== 'selected') return;

        element.
          css({
            display: 'block',
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 500,
            left: 0
          }).
          animate({
            top: 0
          }, done);

        return function animateInEnd(wasCanceled) {
          if (wasCanceled) element.stop();
        };
      }

      function animateOut(element, className, done) {
        if (className !== 'selected') return;

        element.
          css({
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0
          }).
          animate({
            top: -500
          }, done);

        return function animateOutEnd(wasCanceled) {
          if (wasCanceled) element.stop();
        };
      }
    });
```

We are creating a custom animation by specifying the target elements via a CSS class selector (here
`.phone`) and an animation _factory_ function (here `phoneAnimationFactory()`). The factory function
returns an object associating specific _events_ (object keys) to animation _callbacks_ (object
values). The _events_ correspond to DOM actions that `ngAnimate` recognizes and can hook into, such
as `addClass`/`removeClass`/`setClass`, `enter`/`move`/`leave` and `animate`. The associated
callbacks are called by `ngAnimate` at appropriate times.

For more info on animation factories, check out the
{@link ng.$animateProvider#register API Reference}.

In this case, we are interested in a class getting added to/removed from a `.phone` element, thus we
specify callbacks for the `addClass` and `removeClass` events. When the `selected` class is added to
an element (via the `ngClass` directive), the `addClass` JavaScript callback will be executed with
`element` passed in as a parameter. The last parameter passed in is the `done` callback function. We
call `done()` to let AngularJS know that our custom JavaScript animation has ended. The `removeClass`
callback works the same way, but instead gets executed when a class is removed.

Note that we are using [jQuery][jquery]'s `animate()` helper to implement the animation. jQuery
isn't required to do JavaScript animations with AngularJS, but we use it here anyway in order to
keep the example simple. More info on `jQuery.animate()` can be found in the
[jQuery documentation][jquery-animate].

Within the event callbacks, we create the animation by manipulating the DOM. In the code above,
this is achieved using `element.css()` and `element.animate()`. As a result the new element is
positioned with an offset of **500px** and then both elements &mdash; the previous and the new
&mdash; are animated together by shifting each one up by **500px**. The outcome is a conveyor-belt
like animation. After the `animate()` function has completed the animation, it calls `done` to
notify AngularJS.

You may have noticed that each animation callback returns a function. This is an **optional**
function, which (if provided) will be called when the animation ends, either because it ran to
completion or because it was canceled (for example another animation took place on the same
element). A boolean parameter (`wasCanceled`) is passed to the function, letting the developer know
if the animation was canceled or not. Use this function to do any necessary clean-up.


## Experiments

<div></div>

* Reverse the animation, so that the elements animate downwards.

* Make the animation run faster or slower, by passing a `duration` argument to `.animate()`:

  ```js
  element.css({...}).animate({...}, 1000 /* 1 second */, done);
  ```

* Make the animations "asymmetrical". For example, have the previous element fade out, while the new
  element zooms in:

  ```js
  // animateIn()
  element.css({
    display: 'block',
    opacity: 1,
    position: 'absolute',
    width: 0,
    height: 0,
    top: 200,
    left: 200
  }).animate({
    width: 400,
    height: 400,
    top: 0,
    left: 0
  }, done);

  // animateOut()
  element.animate({
    opacity: 0
  }, done);
  ```

* Go crazy and come up with your own funky animations!


## Summary

Our application is now much more pleasant to use, thanks to the smooth transitions between pages
and UI states.

There you have it! We have created a web application in a relatively short amount of time. In the
{@link the_end closing notes} we will cover where to go from here.

@description

Our application is now complete. Feel free to experiment with the code further, and jump back to
previous steps using the `git checkout` command.

For more details and examples of the AngularJS concepts we touched on in this tutorial, see the
{@link guide/ Developer Guide}.

When you are ready to start developing a project using AngularJS, we recommend that you bootstrap
your development with the [angular-seed project][angular-seed].

We hope this tutorial was useful to you and that you learned enough about AngularJS to make you want
to learn more. We especially hope you are inspired to go out and develop AngularJS web applications of
your own, and that you might be interested in {@link misc/contribute contributing} to AngularJS.

If you have questions or feedback or just want to say "hi", please post a message to the
[mailing list][mailing-list]. You can also find us on [IRC][irc] or [Gitter][gitter].
